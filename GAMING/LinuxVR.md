# Running HP Reverb G2 on Arch Linux with SteamVR (RTX 3090, KDE/X11)

Setting up the HP Reverb G2 (a Windows Mixed Reality headset) on Arch Linux **is possible** but requires open-source VR runtimes and some workarounds. There is no official Linux support from HP/Microsoft, but projects like **Monado (OpenXR)** have added experimental compatibility. Below is a comprehensive guide covering the current support status, required software, configuration steps, and limitations for using the Reverb G2 with SteamVR on an Arch Linux system.

## Current Support Status for Reverb G2 on Linux

- **No Native Driver from HP/Microsoft:** Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) headsets like the Reverb G2 are not natively supported on Linux by the manufacturer. SteamVR on Linux also does **not** include a WMR driver. This means you cannot simply plug in the G2 and have SteamVR recognize it without additional software.
    
- **OpenXR/Monado Support:** The open-source **Monado** runtime (OpenXR implementation) has made great strides in supporting WMR devices. As of 2024, Monado includes a **WinMR driver** that supports the Reverb G2’s headset tracking and basic controller input ([Monado OpenXR Runtime: Changelog for Monado](https://monado.pages.freedesktop.org/monado/_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g.html#:~:text=,774%2C%20%21780%2C%20%21782%2C%20%21784%2C%20%21850)). Out of the box, the G2’s **headset** can achieve full **6DoF** (positional) tracking using Monado’s visual-inertial SLAM integration, and the **controllers** are recognized (via Bluetooth or the headset’s radio) but currently default to **3DoF** (orientation-only) tracking ([Monado OpenXR Runtime: Changelog for Monado](https://monado.pages.freedesktop.org/monado/_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g.html#:~:text=,774%2C%20%21780%2C%20%21782%2C%20%21784%2C%20%21850)). An experimental SLAM solution (Basalt) can be used to enable **6DoF** controller tracking, though this is still under active development.
    
- **SteamVR on Linux:** Valve’s SteamVR for Linux does not directly support WMR headsets. In fact, SteamVR on Linux has stagnated – as of early 2025 it has “many unfixable issues” and is considered **abandonware** by much of the Linux VR community ([Virtual reality - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Virtual_reality#:~:text=)). **However**, SteamVR can be made to work with the Reverb G2 by using Monado as an underlying driver. Monado provides a **SteamVR driver plugin** that allows SteamVR to interface with any headsets/controllers Monado supports ([Monado - SteamVR Plugin](https://monado.freedesktop.org/steamvr.html#:~:text=Monado%2021,SteamVR%20plugin)). In practice, this means we can use SteamVR as the OpenVR layer for games, while Monado handles the G2’s hardware. (Alternatively, one can bypass SteamVR entirely using an OpenXR path – more on this later.)
    
- **OpenHMD:** Another open-source project, OpenHMD, had experimental WMR support, but it is less complete than Monado. (For example, an OpenHMD developer build could light up the G2’s display but had issues with tracking ([Hope for WMR on Linux! Controller track reverse engineered, open SLAM track, OpenXR under proton, OpenComposite OpenVR : r/WindowsMR](https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsMR/comments/18nu45p/hope_for_wmr_on_linux_controller_track_reverse/#:~:text=These%20headsets%20currently%20function%20in,with%20vive%20and%20index%20gear)).) The current community focus for WMR on Linux is on Monado, so OpenHMD is generally not recommended for the G2 at this time.
    
- **Wine/Proton & Windows Drivers:** Using the official **Windows WMR driver via Wine/Proton is not a viable solution** in practice. The “Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR” component relies on Windows-specific services (Mixed Reality Portal) which cannot run on Linux. There is currently no known method to get the Windows WMR runtime working under Proton for direct hardware access. (In other words, you can’t realistically run the WMR Portal or driver in Wine – the only path is via open-source reimplementations on Linux.) The community has instead focused on Monado’s native driver to replace the Windows runtime ([Hope for WMR on Linux! Controller track reverse engineered, open SLAM track, OpenXR under proton, OpenComposite OpenVR : r/WindowsMR](https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsMR/comments/18nu45p/hope_for_wmr_on_linux_controller_track_reverse/#:~:text=These%20headsets%20currently%20function%20in,with%20vive%20and%20index%20gear)).
    

**Bottom line:** The HP Reverb G2 can work on Linux via Monado’s OpenXR runtime, often in conjunction with SteamVR (or OpenComposite) to run VR games. Headset tracking is functional (with some glitches), while controller tracking is in early stages. Expect an **experimental** setup – this is cutting-edge, driven by community efforts rather than official support.

## Required Software and Packages on Arch

To set up the Reverb G2 on Arch Linux, you will need to install several components:

- **Monado (OpenXR runtime):** Install the Monado runtime which includes the WinMR driver. On Arch, Monado is available in the AUR. You can use the stable `monado` package or the latest `monado-git`. Given the rapid development for WMR support, you may prefer **`monado-git`** (latest git) along with its SLAM tracking plugin:
    
    - **Monado** – open-source OpenXR runtime ([AUR (en) - monado](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/monado/#:~:text=Description%3A%20An%20open%20source%20OpenXR,002012)).
        
    - **Basalt for Monado** – optional plugin providing 6DoF inside-out tracking. In AUR this is `basalt-monado-git`, listed as an optional dependency for monado-git ([AUR (en) - monado-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/monado-git/#:~:text=%2A%20%20shaderc%20%28shaderc,%E2%80%93%20optical%20tracking%20support)). Installing this before building Monado will allow Monado to use the Basalt SLAM tracker for WMR. (Monado can also integrate ORB-SLAM or Kimera, but those are outdated; Basalt is the primary supported tracker ([AUR (en) - monado-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/monado-git/#:~:text=basalt,release%20tags%20are%20very%20meaningful)).)
        
    - **XR Hardware Udev Rules** – install `xr-hardware` from AUR ([AUR (en) - monado-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/monado-git/#:~:text=%2A%20%20xr,%E2%80%93%20experimental%20SLAM%20tracking%20through)). This provides `/lib/udev/rules.d/70-xrhardware.rules` with proper permissions for VR devices (including WMR headsets and controllers) so that Monado can access USB HID interfaces, cameras, etc., without root ([70-xrhardware.rules · main · Monado / Utilities / xr-hardware · GitLab](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/utilities/xr-hardware/-/blob/main/70-xrhardware.rules#:~:text=70,Hardware%20description%20for%20XR%20devices)) ([Monado OpenXR runtime developer update - Collabora](https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/monado-openxr-runtime-developer-update.html#:~:text=Monado%20OpenXR%20runtime%20developer%20update,also%20useful%20for%20other)).
        
- **SteamVR (OpenVR runtime):** Install SteamVR from Steam. In the Steam client, you can find SteamVR under Tools (or install via `steam` package and then `steamvr` from the Steam library). This will provide the OpenVR runtime. Keep in mind that SteamVR on Linux is older – it’s still required for many games, but we’ll be using it in tandem with Monado. The Arch Wiki recommends installing the following 32-bit libraries which SteamVR needs: **`lib32-gtk2`**, **`lib32-libva`**, and **`lib32-libvdpau`** ([Virtual reality - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Virtual_reality#:~:text=)). Also ensure you have your GPU’s Vulkan drivers (`nvidia-utils` and `lib32-nvidia-utils` for Nvidia, plus `vulkan-icd-loader` and `lib32-vulkan-icd-loader`).
    
- **OpenComposite (optional):** OpenComposite is a project that allows OpenVR games to run directly on OpenXR runtimes (bypassing SteamVR) ([Monado - SteamVR Plugin](https://monado.freedesktop.org/steamvr.html#:~:text=It%20enables%20the%20use%20of,drivers%20with%20Valve%E2%80%99s%20SteamVR%20runtime)). This can improve performance and avoid some SteamVR bugs. You can get it via the AUR (`opencomposite-git`). This isn’t strictly required, but if you plan to run certain games without launching the SteamVR application, OpenComposite is useful. (Envision, discussed below, can set this up automatically.)
    
- **Envision (optional GUI):** [Envision](https://gitlab.com/EnvisionXR) is a GUI tool that automates the setup of Monado, OpenComposite, etc. ([Virtual reality - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Virtual_reality#:~:text=)). It’s available as `envision-xr-git` in AUR. Envision can help you build the needed components and configure an OpenXR+OpenVR “profile” with a few clicks, which is helpful if you want a simpler, guided setup. This is not required if you prefer doing things manually, but the tool is recommended by the community for newcomers.
    
- **Nvidia Drivers:** Ensure you are running the latest Nvidia proprietary driver for your RTX 3090. Newer drivers have better Vulkan support and fixes. (The 3090 should be supported well by the 525+ series drivers or newer. As of kernel 6.14, you likely have a recent driver via Arch’s packages.) There are no special kernel modules needed beyond the standard `nvidia` driver, but see **Nvidia-Specific Configuration** below for important settings related to VR displays.
    
- **Kernel and USB:**
    
    - Your 6.14 kernel is new enough; no special patches are required for WMR. (In the past, some exotic headsets needed kernel patches, but not the G2.) Just make sure your user is in groups that allow USB access if needed (often not necessary if udev rules are set to allow any user).
        
    - If your Reverb G2 has **Bluetooth controllers** (the G2 controllers either connect via the headset’s internal BT or directly to PC’s Bluetooth), ensure you have the Bluetooth service enabled (`bluez` and `bluez-utils` installed) if you plan to pair the controllers directly. Monado’s WinMR driver can handle controllers either tunneled through the headset or via host Bluetooth ([New Monado Release - Appears to add controllers with 6DOF?? : r/HPReverb](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPReverb/comments/1b7mde6/new_monado_release_appears_to_add_controllers/#:~:text=)). (Pairing via the headset is automatic on Windows; on Linux, some users prefer to pair the controllers directly to the PC’s Bluetooth – Monado supports both methods ([New Monado Release - Appears to add controllers with 6DOF?? : r/HPReverb](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPReverb/comments/1b7mde6/new_monado_release_appears_to_add_controllers/#:~:text=)).)
        

## Hardware Setup and Nvidia Configuration

Once the software is installed, connect your HP Reverb G2 to the PC (DisplayPort and USB). Keep the following in mind, especially for Nvidia and KDE (X11) environments:

- **Disable the HMD as a Monitor:** On X11, if the headset is detected as an extra display, you should disable it in your display settings. In NVIDIA’s driver, headsets in the allowlist are hidden by default, but the G2 might **not** be in the allowlist (or if the setting `AllowHMD` is enabled, it could show up) ([Monado - What is Direct Mode](https://monado.freedesktop.org/direct-mode.html#:~:text=The%20closed%20source%20nvidia%20driver,of%20HMD%20displays%20which)). If you see a “HP Reverb G2” display in KDE’s Display Configuration, set it to **disabled** (not part of extended desktop). Direct Mode (where the VR runtime takes exclusive control of the HMD) requires that the OS isn’t driving the headset as a generic monitor ([Monado - What is Direct Mode](https://monado.freedesktop.org/direct-mode.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L116%20The%20nvidia,the%20direct%20mode%20initialization%20will)).
    
- **Nvidia Direct Mode Tips:** The NVIDIA Linux driver historically uses a whitelist of HMD EDIDs to auto-enable direct mode. However, **it can actually use any display in direct mode as long as it’s not active as a desktop output** ([Monado - What is Direct Mode](https://monado.freedesktop.org/direct-mode.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L116%20The%20nvidia,the%20direct%20mode%20initialization%20will)). If the G2 isn’t recognized automatically, Monado might log an error like “No allowlisted displays found” ([Reverb G2 not in nvidia allowlist (#229) · Issues · Monado / Monado · GitLab](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/-/issues/229#:~:text=Result%3A%20XRT_SUCCESS%20DEBUG%20,Valve%20Corporation%20Index%20HMD)). Don’t worry – you can force it:
    
    - One option is to add `Option "AllowHMD" "no"` in your `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d` for the GPU device (this _ensures_ the HMD stays hidden from X). By default, if the G2 isn’t whitelisted, it may appear as a disconnected output; hiding it can sometimes help Monado claim it.
        
    - Alternatively, Monado provides an env variable **`XRT_COMPOSITOR_FORCE_NVIDIA_DISPLAY="<display name>"`** to specify which display to treat as the HMD ([Monado - What is Direct Mode](https://monado.freedesktop.org/direct-mode.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L112%20%60XRT_COMPOSITOR_FORCE_NVIDIA_DISPLAY%3D,output%20of%20a%20previous%20run)). You can get the display identifier from Monado logs or `xrandr`. For example, if Monado lists “HP Inc. (DP-0)” as a found display ([Reverb G2 not in nvidia allowlist (#229) · Issues · Monado / Monado · GitLab](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/-/issues/229#:~:text=ERROR%20,device%20and%20GRAPHICS%20queue%20with)), you can set `XRT_COMPOSITOR_FORCE_NVIDIA_DISPLAY="DP-0"` before launching the service. This will tell Monado to use that output for direct mode even if it’s not auto-detected.
        
    - **Wayland vs X11:** The Arch VR wiki notes that X11 can work but is “discouraged” in favor of Wayland ([VR Gear & GPUs | Linux VR Adventures Wiki](https://lvra.gitlab.io/docs/hardware/#:~:text=headroom%20wiki.archlinux.org%20%20,Wayland%20if%20at%20all%20possible)). Monado _can_ run on X11 (it will try X11 RandR or DRM), but on Nvidia a pure DRM path might be more reliable. If you have trouble on X11, consider testing in a minimal environment (e.g. switch to a tty or use a Wayland session) to see if direct mode engages properly.
        
- **USB Device Access:** After plugging in the G2’s USB, new devices like cameras and sensors will appear. Thanks to the **`xr-hardware`** udev rules, your user should automatically have permission to these (often through plugdev or just globally). If Monado complains about “permission denied” opening a device, check that the `70-xrhardware.rules` is installed and replug the headset. You should see entries for “Microsoft Corp. VR Headset” or similar (the Reverb G2 identifies as a Microsoft VR device) in that udev file, granting access to group `users` or `input`. Ensure your user is in the appropriate group if needed (on Arch, typically just being a normal user is fine as the rule might set ACLs for the active session).
    
- **Firmware:** Make sure your G2 is updated to the latest firmware (this can only be done on Windows). This isn’t strictly a Linux step, but it can resolve hardware bugs (e.g. USB connectivity issues) before you start. If you experience USB disconnects, consider using a powered USB3 hub or a different port, as the G2 is power-hungry on USB.
    

## Configuring Monado (OpenXR Runtime)

With hardware connected and software installed, proceed to get Monado up and running:

1. **Start the Monado Service:** Monado runs a service/daemon that interfaces with VR hardware. You can start it manually for testing. Open a terminal and run:
    
    ```bash
    monado-service -H  (the "-H" runs it in the foreground with logging)
    ```
    
    Watch the console output. Monado should detect the Reverb G2 on startup. You should see lines identifying the headset: e.g. _“Found WMR headset type: HP Reverb G2”_ ([Reverb G2 not in nvidia allowlist (#229) · Issues · Monado / Monado · GitLab](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/-/issues/229#:~:text=INFO%20,0.894674%20right%200.729563%20down)) and details like FoV, etc. If everything is configured correctly, Monado will also initialize the display in direct mode. Successful direct mode is indicated by messages about Vulkan swapchains and no errors about “No non-desktop output” (on AMD/Intel, “non-desktop” output would be found; on Nvidia, you rely on the force method or allowlist) ([Reverb G2 not in nvidia allowlist (#229) · Issues · Monado / Monado · GitLab](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/-/issues/229#:~:text=ERROR%20,224)).
    
    - **If the headset display stays blank (solid color) or Monado reports it couldn’t find a display:** This means direct mode didn’t engage. Double-check the **Nvidia config** above. If using X11, ensure the HMD is not treated as a desktop monitor. You may try killing your desktop session and running `monado-service` on a VT to see if it can grab the display. Also try the `XRT_COMPOSITOR_FORCE_NVIDIA_DISPLAY` env. It can be a bit of trial and error on Nvidia. (One user reported seeing a blank white screen in the G2 until using the proper direct mode config; using tools like Envision helped set the correct parameters ([WMR headset tracking works with Monado + Basalt, but display is blank (white), generally not working/communicating?? : r/virtualreality_linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality_linux/comments/1edafir/wmr_headset_tracking_works_with_monado_basalt_but/#:~:text=Infranscia)) ([WMR headset tracking works with Monado + Basalt, but display is blank (white), generally not working/communicating?? : r/virtualreality_linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality_linux/comments/1edafir/wmr_headset_tracking_works_with_monado_basalt_but/#:~:text=someone%20else%20runs%20into%20a,similar%20issue%2C%20hopefully%20this%27ll%20help)).)
        
    - **If tracking is working:** Even with a blank screen, Monado might still be tracking. You can enable a debug GUI to visualize tracking data. Run `monado-service` with `XRT_DEBUG_GUI=1 SLAM_TRACKING=1` environment variables to pop up a window showing the SLAM feature points and headset pose. If you see the point cloud moving as you move the headset, the cameras and IMU are working, and it’s purely a display output issue to solve.
        
    - **Controller pairing:** Monado will attempt to connect to the G2 controllers. Turn on your controllers (they should flash and attempt to pair). If they were previously paired to the G2 on Windows, the headset’s internal radio might link to them. Monado’s log will show if it found controllers. If not, you can put the controllers in pairing mode and use Linux’s Bluetooth to pair them (they appear as “Motion Controller” devices). Monado supports both direct Bluetooth and tunneled connections ([New Monado Release - Appears to add controllers with 6DOF?? : r/HPReverb](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPReverb/comments/1b7mde6/new_monado_release_appears_to_add_controllers/#:~:text=)). Initially, expect the controllers to be only orientation-tracked (3DoF) – they will rotate and buttons will work, but their position might stay at the headset origin unless you enable experimental tracking (see **Experimental 6DoF Controllers** below).
        
2. **Register Monado as the OpenXR Runtime:** Arch’s Monado package should drop an OpenXR JSON in `/usr/share/openxr/1/openxr_monado.json`. You may need to set the environment variable to use Monado as the active OpenXR runtime:
    
    ```bash
    export XR_RUNTIME_JSON=/usr/share/openxr/1/openxr_monado.json
    ```
    
    This is only needed for running OpenXR programs _directly_. (SteamVR will not use this; it has its own mechanism.) You can test Monado with the example programs like `hello_xr` (from the OpenXR-SDK, or Monado’s demos) to ensure the headset’s pose is coming through.
    
3. **(Optional) Use Envision:** If manual steps are troublesome, launch `envision` (it’s a GUI app). Envision can detect that you have Monado and will allow you to create a profile (e.g. “Monado + OpenComposite”). It can also compile missing pieces. For instance, it can build Basalt and OpenComposite for you if they weren’t installed. Several users have found Envision helpful in resolving issues – it automates the configuration that gets Monado’s service and SteamVR working together ([WMR headset tracking works with Monado + Basalt, but display is blank (white), generally not working/communicating?? : r/virtualreality_linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality_linux/comments/1edafir/wmr_headset_tracking_works_with_monado_basalt_but/#:~:text=Infranscia)). Since you already installed packages, you might use it just to double-check everything (e.g. Envision’s log will indicate if it can run Monado service successfully).
    

## Integrating Monado with SteamVR (OpenVR)

To get SteamVR and games to recognize the headset via Monado:

1. **SteamVR External Driver Registration:** Monado’s SteamVR driver plugin needs to be registered so SteamVR knows about it. This is done with Valve’s `vrpathreg` tool. Assuming SteamVR is installed under `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR`, run:
    
    ```bash
    ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/vrpathreg.sh adddriver /usr/share/steamvr-monado
    ```
    
    (Adjust the path if your Steam library is elsewhere, e.g. `~/.local/share/Steam/...`). This command adds Monado’s driver directory to SteamVR’s list of **external drivers**. You can verify by running `vrpathreg.sh` with no arguments – it should list `/usr/share/steamvr-monado` under _External Drivers_ ([Monado - SteamVR Plugin](https://monado.freedesktop.org/steamvr.html#:~:text=)). _(Note: If you built Monado from source, you’d use the build path. With the AUR package, it’s installed to `/usr/share/steamvr-monado`.)_
    
2. **Launch SteamVR:** Start SteamVR (you can do this from Steam’s interface or by running `steamvr`). The first time, SteamVR might do some setup. If Monado is running and the driver registered, SteamVR should detect the headset **through Monado**. In the SteamVR status window, you’ll likely see an icon for the headset (it might show as “Mixed Reality” or a generic icon) and icons for two controllers. If all is well, the headset icon will turn green (tracking) when you move the HMD, and you may see a glimpse of the SteamVR grid in the headset. 🎉
    
    - If SteamVR says “Headset not detected” or similar: check the SteamVR log at `~/.steam/steam/logs/vrserver.txt`. Look for lines prefixed with `monado:` – if you see errors there, the Monado plugin might not be loading. Ensure you ran `vrpathreg` correctly. Also verify that `MONADO_SERVICE_URI` environment variable isn’t needed – typically the driver auto-launches monado-service if not already running. Sometimes running `monado-service` _before_ SteamVR helps stability (SteamVR will connect to the already-running service).
        
    - **SteamVR on NVIDIA:** Note that SteamVR might _itself_ have issues on Nvidia. The Arch Wiki mentions an env var for Vulkan ICD selection: you might set `VK_DRIVER_FILES=/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/nvidia_icd.json` before launching SteamVR to make sure it uses the Nvidia Vulkan drive ([Virtual reality - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Virtual_reality#:~:text=))】. This can help if SteamVR was built with assumptions for Mesa drivers.
        
3. **SteamVR Room Setup and Interaction:** You can skip room setup (since WMR doesn’t have basestations, you’ll likely use “Standing” play space only). The Reverb G2 has inside-out tracking, so there is no base station to define a room origin – Monado will create a coordinate system where you started the service (it supports “Local Floor” space if it can detect the floor when you started, or you might have to manually recenter). Use the SteamVR dashboard to recenter if needed.
    
    In the SteamVR Settings > Controller, you **may need to customize bindings** for the WMR controllers. Monado generates default SteamVR input profiles for supported controller ([Monado - SteamVR Plugin](https://monado.freedesktop.org/steamvr.html#:~:text=,use%20generated%20SteamVR%20input%20profiles)) ([Monado - SteamVR Plugin](https://monado.freedesktop.org/steamvr.html#:~:text=Since%20v21,input%20profiles%20for%20SteamVR))】, but sometimes games don’t know how to handle a “Windows MR Controller” on Linux. A common workaround is to set the controllers to impersonate Vive wands: in SteamVR, go to Devices > Controller Settings > **“Pretend to be Vive Controllers”** (this option is provided by Monado’s driver ([Monado - SteamVR Plugin](https://monado.freedesktop.org/steamvr.html#:~:text=There%20are%20various%20tutorials%20how,Vive%20Controller)) ([Monado - SteamVR Plugin](https://monado.freedesktop.org/steamvr.html#:~:text=,Vive%20Controller))】. This makes SteamVR present them as Vive wands to games, which improves compatibility in many cases.
    
4. **Run VR Games:** You can now launch VR games. Native Linux VR titles (if any) can use SteamVR+Monado directly. More commonly, you’ll run Windows VR games via **Proton**. Steam’s Proton will translate the game’s OpenVR calls to the Linux SteamVR. For example, launch **Beat Saber** or **Half-Life: Alyx** in Steam – they will run through Proton and should find SteamVR running (with your headset). If everything is configured, the game will appear in the headset!
    
    - **OpenXR Games:** Some newer games (especially simulators) can use OpenXR. If a game offers an OpenXR mode (e.g. Microsoft Flight Simulator, DCS World with OpenXR, etc.), you might try to use that with Monado directly, avoiding SteamVR. This would entail setting `XR_RUNTIME_JSON` to Monado’s JSON and running the game via Proton with OpenXR. However, Proton’s handling of OpenXR is tricky – by default Proton might try to use SteamVR’s OpenXR runtime. Using OpenComposite may actually be easier: see below.
        
5. **Using OpenComposite (Optional):** Instead of running SteamVR, you can have OpenComposite intercept a game’s OpenVR API calls and route them to Monado (OpenXR). This is advanced, but it can reduce overhead. To do this on a per-game basis, you typically replace the game’s `openvr_api.dll` with OpenComposite’s DLL (or use a system-wide switch). On Linux, the OpenComposite project by Zack Fannon (znix) has a Linux OpenXR laye ([Setup Monado, libsurvive and OpenComposite for the Valve Index](https://monado.freedesktop.org/valve-index-setup.html#:~:text=OpenComposite%20,in%20this%20order))】. If you installed `opencomposite-git`, you have a `libopenvr_api.so` or similar that can act as a drop-in. Envision can also set up OpenComposite automatically for installed games.

This resulted in improved performance and stability for that use-case. If you’re comfortable with manual tweaking, using OpenComposite is worth exploring for each game after you have the basic setup working.
    

## Known Limitations and Troubleshooting

While the above steps should get you up and running, be prepared for quirks and limitations:

- **WMR Controller Tracking:** The biggest limitation is the state of controller tracking. As of early 2025, the Reverb G2’s controllers can be used but **only with 3DoF tracking** (rotation) unless you build experimental branches. Full inside-out 6DoF tracking for WMR controllers is **work in progress**. The Monado team has demonstrated 6DoF controller tracking in development, and recent Monado releases officially include the groundwork for it (using the Basalt SLAM tracker ([New Monado Release - Appears to add controllers with 6DOF?? : r/HPReverb](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPReverb/comments/1b7mde6/new_monado_release_appears_to_add_controllers/#:~:text=)) ([VR in Linux without Steam - VR in X-Plane 12 - X-Plane.Org Forum](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/294764-vr-in-linux-without-steam/#:~:text=Support%20for%20the%20Reverb%20G2,that%20will%20be%20arriving%20soon))】. However, expect some jitter or instability. In practice, this means you might be able to pull the trigger and press buttons, but the system may treat the controller as if it’s always at a fixed position relative to your head (unless you apply the experimental tracker). This severely impacts games where you need to reach out and grab objects. **Workaround:** For now, games that rely less on precise controller positioning are more playable. You can also use alternative input methods (gamepad, HOTAS, racing wheel, etc.) for games like flight and racing sims, where you mainly need the head tracking and maybe a few buttons.
    
- **Headset Tracking Quality:** Inside-out SLAM tracking on Monado is still maturing. The G2’s head tracking might exhibit some drift or jitter, especially during fast motio ([VR in Linux without Steam - VR in X-Plane 12 - X-Plane.Org Forum](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/294764-vr-in-linux-without-steam/#:~:text=I%20was%20pleasantly%20surprised%20today,no%20translation%29%2C%20but)) ([VR in Linux without Steam - VR in X-Plane 12 - X-Plane.Org Forum](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/294764-vr-in-linux-without-steam/#:~:text=match%20at%20L514%20Support%20for,Both%20of%20these))】.

The Basalt tracker helps mitigate drift (Basalt includes IMU bias correction for the G2’s known IMU thermal drift issu ([VR in Linux without Steam - X-Plane.Org Forum](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/294764-vr-in-linux-without-steam/#:~:text=VR%20in%20Linux%20without%20Steam,in%20the%20G2%20and))】). If you find the view slowly drifting, you may need to reset orientation periodically (SteamVR has a “reset seated position” function). Tracking is likely to improve as the algorithms are tuned – keep your Monado up-to-date.
    
- **Performance and SteamVR Bugs:** SteamVR on Linux can be less stable than on Windows. You might encounter crashes or quirks:
    
    - **SteamVR Compositor issues:** Sometimes SteamVR’s compositor (which renders the chaperone, dashboard, etc.) might hang or flicker. If a game fails to display, try restarting SteamVR. Running on X11, you might also see the headset mirror on your desktop or strange resolution switches. These are symptoms of SteamVR’s aging Linux suppor ([Virtual reality - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Virtual_reality#:~:text=))】. Using OpenXR directly (OpenComposite path) can sidestep some of these.
        
    - **No Motion Smoothing/Reprojection:** SteamVR’s advanced reprojection (ASW/Motion Smoothing) isn’t really available on Linux for WMR. What you get is what you render – if the GPU can’t maintain 90 FPS, you’ll get lower framerates without the interpolation that Windows WMR does. You may need to tweak game settings to achieve a stable framerate. Lowering SteamVR’s supersampling resolution is often necessary for the high-resolution G2 – you can do this in SteamVR Video settings or via environment variables for Monado (Monado allows setting custom render resolution/refresh via env, as mentioned in the X-Plane foru ([VR in Linux without Steam - VR in X-Plane 12 - X-Plane.Org Forum](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/294764-vr-in-linux-without-steam/#:~:text=4,XP))】).
        
    - **NVIDIA GPU limitations:** NVIDIA’s proprietary driver can have higher VR latency compared to AMD on Linux. The community has hopes for the upcoming **NVK** open-source driver to improve thi ([VR in Linux without Steam - VR in X-Plane 12 - X-Plane.Org Forum](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/294764-vr-in-linux-without-steam/#:~:text=Lastly%2C%20for%20now%2C%20Nvidia%20users,It%27s%20looking%20good%20so%20far))】. For now, just be aware that you might not get the same low latency as on Windows. Ensure you run on a fullscreen Vulkan application (no compositor in the way) to minimize overhead.
        
- **Display quirks:** If the headset display refuses to turn on (stays black or white) but tracking works, it’s almost always a direct mode problem. Double-check that the G2’s display is not being grabbed by the desktop. On KDE, disabling it in System Settings should suffice. If needed, use an Xorg config to force it as non-desktop. As a brute-force debug, boot with only the HMD plugged in (no other monitors) – BIOS/boot on the G2 will look strange, but once Linux loads, Monado will definitely try to use it. Then plug monitors back in. This isn’t a permanent solution but can help verify the HMD panel works under Linux at all.
    
- **Audio:** Don’t forget that the Reverb G2 has built-in headphones and mic. On Linux, the G2’s audio may show up as a USB sound device. Use PulseAudio or PipeWire settings to switch the audio output to the G2’s speakers and input from its mic when VR is running. There’s no automatic audio switching like WMR Portal does, so you have to set it up manually (or via a script).
    
- **Staying Updated:** Given the fast pace of development, keep an eye on community resources:
    
    - The **Linux VR Discord/Matrix** (linked from Monado’s site) is very activ ([Hope for WMR on Linux! Controller track reverse engineered, open SLAM track, OpenXR under proton, OpenComposite OpenVR : r/WindowsMR](https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsMR/comments/18nu45p/hope_for_wmr_on_linux_controller_track_reverse/#:~:text=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord))】. You can get real-time help from developers and testers (Monado’s lead WMR developer, @thaytan, often hangs out there).
        
    - The **Linux VR Adventures Wiki (LVRA)** is a community-driven wiki with up-to-date instructions and tip ([Hope for WMR on Linux! Controller track reverse engineered, open SLAM track, OpenXR under proton, OpenComposite OpenVR : r/WindowsMR](https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsMR/comments/18nu45p/hope_for_wmr_on_linux_controller_track_reverse/#:~:text=We%20have%20a%20wiki%20located,get%20you%20up%20to%20speed))】. In particular, it maintains tables of device support – it lists the HP Reverb G2 as supported via Monado (with “experimental 6DoF controllers” ([VR Gear & GPUs | Linux VR Adventures Wiki](https://lvra.gitlab.io/docs/hardware/#:~:text=HP%20Reverb%20%E2%9C%85%20,WiVRn))】, and provides guides for using Envision, etc.
        
    - Monado’s **Gitlab issue tracker** and merge requests are the best place to see current progress. For example, the Monado changelog notes that distortion correction is best tuned for the Reverb G2 and many MR !MRs are specifically tested with the G ([Monado OpenXR Runtime: Changelog for Monado](https://monado.pages.freedesktop.org/monado/_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g.html#:~:text=,774%2C%20%21780%2C%20%21782%2C%20%21784%2C%20%21850))】. If you encounter a bug, search there – you might find an open issue or a fix in the pipeline.
        
    - **Reddit and Forums:** The subreddits r/virtualreality_linux and r/HPReverb have occasional threads on Linux support. (Just be mindful that things change quickly; a 6-month-old post might be outdated.) The X-Plane.org forum thread we referenced is a goldmine for tips on WMR with Monado, including user-made scripts and patche ([VR in Linux without Steam - VR in X-Plane 12 - X-Plane.Org Forum](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/294764-vr-in-linux-without-steam/#:~:text=The%20final%20binaries%20are%20NOT,are%20retained%2C%20it%27s%206%20gig)) ([VR in Linux without Steam - VR in X-Plane 12 - X-Plane.Org Forum](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/294764-vr-in-linux-without-steam/#:~:text=Support%20for%20the%20Reverb%20G2,that%20will%20be%20arriving%20soon))】.

- **Windows Support Ending (FYI):** Interestingly, Microsoft has **deprecated WMR on Windows 11** (as of the 24H2 update in late 2024). The official WMR for SteamVR is end-of-life and will stop receiving updates after 202 ([Windows 11 No Longer Supports Microsoft's Windows VR Headsets Following October Update](https://www.roadtovr.com/windows-11-drops-wmr-support-24h2/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWindows%20Mixed%20Reality%C2%A0is%20deprecated%20and,%E2%80%9D)) ([Windows 11 No Longer Supports Microsoft's Windows VR Headsets Following October Update](https://www.roadtovr.com/windows-11-drops-wmr-support-24h2/#:~:text=Provided%20you%20don%E2%80%99t%C2%A0update%20to%20the%C2%A024H2,technical%20content%20updates%2C%20Microsoft%20said))】. This means the community-driven Linux support is not just a novelty – it could become the primary way to keep devices like the Reverb G2 alive in the future. Keep your Linux VR stack updated, as we can expect rapid improvements with more users and developers joining after Microsoft’s pull-back.
    

## Playable Experiences and Final Tips

Given the current state, **what works best on this setup?** Users have reported success with simulation and seated experiences where controller 6DoF isn’t critical. For example:

- **Flight simulators** (X-Plane 12, FlightGear, etc.) using head tracking for looking around, along with HOTAS or yoke for control ([VR in Linux without Steam - VR in X-Plane 12 - X-Plane.Org Forum](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/294764-vr-in-linux-without-steam/#:~:text=I%20was%20pleasantly%20surprised%20today,Very%20encouraging))】. The visuals were “graphically identical to Windows 10” in one repor ([VR in Linux without Steam - VR in X-Plane 12 - X-Plane.Org Forum](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/294764-vr-in-linux-without-steam/#:~:text=I%20was%20pleasantly%20surprised%20today,Very%20encouraging))】, aside from some tracking drift.
    
- **Racing games** (e.g. via Proton: Assetto Corsa, Project Cars) with a steering wheel and pedals.
    
- **Virtual desktop/cinema** applications or 360-video playback (there are OpenXR apps for these) – these only need the headset.
    
- **Basic VR games with gamepad support:** Some indie games or older titles allow using a gamepad instead of motion controllers, which can be a workaround until controllers improve.
    
- **Beat Saber (experimental):** With the latest Monado and Basalt tracking, there is proof that even Beat Saber is playable – a developer managed to complete a level with fully tracked WMR controllers on Monado in Mar 202 ([2024-03-16 First time completing a Beat Saber level with Monado ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05H5a1t6HnE#:~:text=2024,1K%20views%208%20months%20ago))】. This required compiling bleeding-edge branches, so your mileage may vary. It shows the potential as development continues.
    

Always start with lower-intensity scenarios to validate your setup. Use Monado’s example XR apps (like `svr_client` or `xrgears`) to test performance and tracking in a simple environment. Then try a known stable VR game (maybe something like **The Lab** via Proton, which is free and not too demanding) to confirm SteamVR + Monado are cooperating.

If you run into issues, don’t hesitate to reach out on the community forums or Discord. Given the complexity of this setup, small tweaks can make a big difference, and fellow Linux VR enthusiasts are usually happy to share config tips. The landscape is steadily improving, and by investing the time now, you’re on the cutting edge of a fully open-source VR ecosystem.
