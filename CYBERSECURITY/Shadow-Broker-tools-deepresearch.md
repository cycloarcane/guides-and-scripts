# The Shadow Brokers Leaks – Tools and Exploits Overview

## August 2016 “Equation Group” Leak (Firewall Operations)

In August 2016, the Shadow Brokers released an **“Equation Group” leak** containing NSA-developed exploits and implants targeting enterprise firewalls and network gear. This dump (about 250 MB) focused on firewall “operation” tools, many of which were *zero-day* at the time and prompted vendor patches. Key tools from this leak include:

* **EGREGIOUSBLUNDER** – *Fortinet FortiGate firewall exploit.* A remote code execution (RCE) attack via an HTTP cookie overflow, affecting multiple FortiGate models (e.g. 60, 200A, 620B, 800, etc.). The exploit identifies the target model via the FortiGate web interface’s ETag header and then triggers a buffer overflow in the cookie parser to execute code on the device. **Status:** Fortinet released fixes for this 0-day (later assigned CVE-2016-6909), noting it impacted only older FortiOS firmware (superseded by 2012). No widespread public abuse was reported, but it confirmed NSA’s capability against FortiGate firewalls.

* **EXTRABACON** – *Cisco ASA firewall exploit.* An RCE exploit targeting a buffer overflow in Cisco’s ASA/PIX SNMP service. By sending crafted SNMP packets (with knowledge of the device’s uptime and version), an attacker can overflow the SNMP process and gain control. **Status:** Cisco confirmed this as a 0-day (CVE-2016-6366) and quickly patched it in August 2016. It affects ASA versions 8.0(2) through 8.4(4) and was one of the most alarming revelations, since ASA devices are widely used. NSA attackers would use EXTRABACON to get a foothold into network perimeters. No known public attacks occurred prior to the patch, given its stealthy nature.

* **EPICBANANA** – *Cisco ASA/PIX exploit (privilege escalation).* This tool exploits a command-injection vulnerability (CVE-2016-6367) in certain Cisco ASA/PIX firmware versions. Uniquely, it required **valid credentials** (a default or stolen password) and then invoked undocumented commands to achieve code execution or a denial-of-service. It affected older ASA versions (up to 8.4(2)). **Status:** Patched by Cisco in 2016. EPICBANANA highlights that Equation Group not only had remote exploits, but also ways to elevate privileges *after* getting basic access (e.g. via default creds). It underscores the importance of disabling default accounts (the exploit even leveraged the default “cisco/cisco” login).

* **ESCALATEPLOWMAN** – *WatchGuard firewall exploit.* A Linux-based privilege escalation that injects code via the `ifconfig` command on WatchGuard Fireware OS. By leveraging a command injection, it gains root on WatchGuard appliances. **Status:** Affects unspecified older WatchGuard versions; no CVE was assigned publicly. WatchGuard stated these were legacy issues already resolved or in EOL devices in 2016.

* **“Topsec” firewall exploits (China)** – Several exploits targeted Topsec, a Chinese firewall vendor, showing Equation Group’s international reach. For example, **ELIGIBLEBOMBSHELL** exploited an HTTP cookie command-injection on Topsec TOS 3.2/3.3 firmware, while **ELIGIBLECANDIDATE** and **ELIGIBLECONTESTANT** exploited HTTP parameter injection on later Topsec versions. These were RCE exploits that delivered tailored payloads (code-named **WOBBLYLLAMA**, **FLOCKFORWARD**, **HIDDENTEMPLE**, etc., each a stage payload for specific Topsec firmware versions). **Status:** These Topsec exploits were not widely publicized by the vendor (Topsec is less common outside China), but the leak suggests NSA had *zero-days* on foreign security appliances. Likely patched quietly or rendered obsolete by newer Topsec OS releases.

* **FALSEMOREL** – *Credential theft tool (possibly Cisco).* Rather than an exploit, this tool allows deduction of a device’s **enable password** from accessible data. It appears to leverage the hash of the Cisco enable password (if Telnet is open internally) to escalate privileges. In practice, FALSEMOREL would let an NSA operator who has *some* access (e.g. config or hash) recover the plaintext enable password to fully control a router or firewall. **Status:** Not a vulnerability in itself, but a post-exploit technique. Emphasizes that Equation Group toolkit included *password-cracking implants* to facilitate lateral movement.

**Implants and Persistence:** In addition to exploits, the August 2016 dump revealed a range of *implants* – malware payloads designed to reside on compromised devices:

* **BANANAGLEE** – A *non-persistent* implant for Cisco ASA/PIX firewalls. It is loaded directly into memory (without writing to disk/flash), giving the attacker a backdoor until the device reboots. BANANAGLEE was often delivered via the EXTRABACON exploit, granting NSA interactive control over the firewall. A related BIOS-level implant called **BANANABALLOT** was also listed, likely to facilitate BANANAGLEE’s injection at boot.

* **JETPLOW** – A *firmware persistence* implant for Cisco ASA/PIX. JETPLOW would **survive reboots** by injecting malicious code into the device’s firmware, ensuring BANANAGLEE or similar payloads persist indefinitely. Cisco acknowledged JETPLOW (it was mentioned in earlier NSA ANT leaks as well) and noted it required physical or admin access to install; still, its exposure showed NSA could maintain long-term stealth access to network infrastructure.

* **FEEDTROUGH** – A persistence technique for Juniper **NetScreen** firewalls (which run ScreenOS). It’s designed to persist two implants called **ZESTYLEAK** and **BANANAGLEE** on NetScreen devices. Essentially, FEEDTROUGH is a hidden backdoor that survives firmware upgrades, ensuring that NSA malware (“two-stage implants”) remains *through* device reboots or software updates.

* **BARGLEE & ZESTYLEAK** – Implants for Juniper NetScreen firewalls. **BARGLEE** is analogous to BANANAGLEE but for NetScreen devices, while **ZESTYLEAK** is another implant or module for NetScreen (possibly to exfiltrate data). These demonstrate the Equation Group had platform-specific malware for *multiple* firewall brands (Cisco, Fortinet, Juniper, Topsec, etc.), enabling deep persistence in diverse network environments.

* **BUZZDIRECTION** – An implant for Fortinet FortiGate firewalls. This would be the counterpart that NSA could drop on Fortigate after exploiting it (e.g. via EgregiousBlunder). It indicates FortiGate devices, once compromised, could be subverted long-term to exfiltrate data or serve as beachheads.

* **Polarpaws/Polarsneeze** – Code names for other firewall implants of unknown vendor (possibly smaller or legacy systems). Little was disclosed beyond their names, but their presence implies thorough coverage of different target systems.

Notably, the leak also included numerous implant **modules** (mostly prefixed with “B” for BANANAGLEE/BARGLEE). Examples include *BBALL, BBANJO, BCANDY, BFLEA, BMASSACRE,* etc., which are plugin modules extending implant functionality. These modules likely provided specific capabilities (e.g. packet capture, keystroke logging, pivoting) to the main firewall implants. The sheer number of modules (over a dozen) highlights the *sophistication* – the NSA had a full “implant kit” for network devices, allowing operators to mix-and-match capabilities.

**Tools and Utilities:** The Shadow Brokers’ firewall leak also exposed various *hacking utilities* used alongside the exploits/implants:

* **SECONDDATE** – A network *packet injection* tool. It can intercept and modify web traffic on the fly, likely used to redirect targets to exploit servers. SECONDDATE was mentioned as a module that works with BANANAGLEE/BARGLEE implants to inject malicious payloads into network streams for further compromise.

* **DURABLENAPKIN** – A tool for injecting packets on LANs. This could be used for ARP spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks once inside a network. For example, an operator on a compromised firewall could use DURABLENAPKIN to insert packets to exploit an internal server.

* **NOPEN** – A *post-exploitation remote shell* tool. NOPEN is essentially an encrypted backdoor shell (client-server) that an operator can use for Unix or Windows targets. It provides an interactive command-line on the target with traffic encrypted (it uses RC6 encryption). NSA operators would install NOPEN on high-value targets to maintain access; it produces minimal logging and was designed to evade detection. NOPEN was known from prior leaks and is a staple of Equation Group’s toolkit for hands-on keyboard access to victims.

* **BENIGNCERTAIN** – An exploit tool for IPSec VPNs (IKE protocol). This tool sends crafted IKEv1 packets to VPN gateways and *retrieves chunks of memory*, potentially extracting secret material (like RSA private keys for VPN authentication). Cisco analyzed BENIGNCERTAIN and discovered it targeted legacy Cisco PIX and IOS devices’ IKE implementation, allowing leakage of VPN credentials. **Status:** Cisco confirmed a related IKEv1 memory leak vulnerability (CVE-2016-6415) and patched it in 2016. BENIGNCERTAIN underscores how NSA could defeat VPN encryption by stealing keys from network devices’ memory.

* **BILLOCEAN** – A utility to grab the serial number of a Fortigate firewall (used as an opsec note for FortiGate ops alongside EGREGIOUSBLUNDER). Serial numbers might be needed to generate valid checksum or licenses if the implant needed to blend in. It’s a small example of the meticulous approach: even serial numbers were harvested for operational security.

* **Other scripts/tools:** *BANANALIAR* (connect to BANANAGLEE implants), *BARICE* (shell for installing BARGLEE), *XTRACTPLEASING* (extracts data from files and outputs PCAPs), *TEFLONDOOR* (a self-destructing backdoor shell that runs a payload and removes itself). These support tools illustrate end-to-end operations: from exploitation to data exfiltration and covering tracks.

**Impact and Patches (Firewall Leak):** Cisco and Fortinet quickly confirmed the leaked exploits were genuine NSA tools. Cisco issued advisories and patches for EXTRABACON and EPICBANANA (and investigated others) the same month. Fortinet likewise patched FortiOS for EGREGIOUSBLUNDER (FortiOS 4.x). The exposed implants (BANANAGLEE, JETPLOW, etc.) put vendors and organizations on alert to *audit their firmware* for unauthorized modifications. While no public mass attacks with these specific firewall exploits were reported (likely due to their specialized nature and limited availability), the leak was a wake-up call: nation-state malware had been **sitting latent in critical infrastructure**. It’s suspected that other actors quickly analyzed the dump – for instance, criminals could repurpose exploits for any still-vulnerable devices, and defensive teams gained invaluable IOCs to detect NSA malware. Overall, the August 2016 Shadow Brokers leak pulled back the curtain on NSA’s “big game hunting” of network devices, prompting a wave of preventive device upgrades and demonstrating the NSA’s advanced capabilities in compromising backbone security appliances.

## “Trick or Treat” and Mid-2016 Leaks (October–November 2016)

Following the initial August release, the Shadow Brokers continued to trickle out information. On October 31, 2016 (Halloween), they published a “**Trick or Treat**” leak – not new exploits, but a list of **server-side operation notes and keys** for NSA “staging servers” around the world. This included configuration data referencing Equation Group tool codenames like **DEWDROP, INCISION, JACKLADDER, ORANGUTAN, PATCHICILLIN, SIDETRACK, RETICULUM,** and **STOICSURGEON**. These appear to be NSA *operations or malware names* from 2000–2010, and the leak provided their redirector domains or encryption keys. While no actual binaries were dumped, this *revealed NSA infrastructure*: dozens of compromised servers (in China, Russia, India, Sweden, etc.) that were used to launch or host exploits. It essentially doxxed NSA’s covert network of hacked machines. Security researchers mapped these to known APT servers, validating Equation Group’s global presence.

Then in November 2016, Shadow Brokers released more Equation Group data. Notably, they leaked an exploit tool for **Sun Solaris** systems, along with a list of **hacked Solaris servers** used by NSA as staging platforms. The tool was likely an exploit against Solaris *Telnet or RPC services* (one referenced name is “EXTREMEPARR”, a Solaris exploit for the “dtappgather” service, which affects Solaris 7–11). Additionally, IP addresses and domains of NSA-controlled servers were exposed. One such Solaris exploit was later confirmed as **EXTREMEPARR**, a zero-day allowing root on Solaris via the CDE utility *dtappgather* (no CVE at leak time). **Status:** Oracle eventually patched this (CVE-2017-6361) after it came to light.

These interim leaks (Oct–Nov 2016) did not dump large new toolsets, but they *burned NSA infrastructure and hinted at future leaks*. They showed NSA had exploits beyond just firewalls – e.g., hitting Unix servers. At this point, Shadow Brokers had proven authenticity, but still held back the crown jewels (Windows exploits). Their auction had failed, and by early 2017 they were preparing a final salvo.

## January 2017 “Farewell” Release (Windows Tools)

On January 12, 2017, the Shadow Brokers announced they were “calling it quits” and, as a parting gift, **freely leaked an archive of Windows hacking tools**. This dump contained *nearly 60 NSA tools and exploits for Windows*, many dating from around 2013 or earlier. Unlike the later April leak, these were mostly older implants and *already-known vulnerabilities* (no new zero-days for supported systems, according to Microsoft). Kaspersky Lab, which had uncovered the Equation Group in 2015, noted that most of these tools were already detected by their AV signatures – a sign that they corresponded to malware active in the early 2010s that Kaspersky had studied (like “EquationDrug” and “GrayFish” espionage platforms).

Some notable components of the January dump included:

* **PASSFREELY** – An exploit implant to **bypass Oracle database authentication**. This Windows tool patches the Oracle DB process in memory so that *any password* works for any user. It supports 386 different Oracle versions (Oracle 7.2 through 11.2) and was used to target SWIFT financial systems (since SWIFT’s back-end runs on Oracle databases). With PASSFREELY, an NSA operator who already compromised a SWIFT bureau’s server could invisibly access transaction databases without credentials. **Status:** No CVE; it’s a post-compromise *in-memory patch*. Oracle quietly confirmed the issue in 2017 but did not issue public patches (as it’s not a persistent vulnerability but an attack technique). This tool was later explicitly linked to NSA monitoring of Middle East banks.

* **EQLSHELL/ODDJOB** – A “*framework*” for controlling compromised Windows machines. Codenamed **Oddjob**, this appears to be an NSA *malware orchestration platform* or loader, possibly an early version of DanderSpritz’s controller for implants. The January leak included scripts and configs for Oddjob, indicating it was used to *build and send payloads* on victim machines. It had very low antivirus detection at the time. Oddjob could manage **“Windows implants”** (as NSA’s internal term) on victim PCs, scheduling tasks, injecting DLLs, or manipulating Windows services for persistence. In essence, Oddjob functioned like a covert administrator toolkit for post-exploitation.

* **Windows Exploits (Older):** A number of exploits for Windows OS vulnerabilities (2008 and earlier) were part of this dump. These included:

  * **ECLIPSEDWING** – Exploit for the famous MS08-067 vulnerability in Windows Server service (the bug behind the 2008 Conficker worm). It allows remote code execution via crafted SMB packets. Equation Group had their own implementation of this exploit (likely more advanced/reliable than the public Conficker exploit). **Status:** Patched in 2008 (MS08-067).
  * **EDUCATEDSCHOLAR** – Exploit for MS09-050 (SMBv2 overflow on Windows Vista/Server 2008). This bug could cause a kernel crash or RCE; the NSA tool was capable of exploitation, not just DoS. **Status:** Patched in 2009 (MS09-050).
  * **EMERALDTHREAD** – Exploit for MS10-061 (Print Spooler impersonation vulnerability). This vulnerability (CVE-2010-2729) was used by Stuxnet; it allows a remote or local attacker to execute code via the print spooler service. The NSA’s EmeraldThread likely was used to rapidly propagate in internal networks by exploiting printers/spooler on unpatched machines. **Status:** Patched in 2010 (MS10-061).
  * **ESKIMOROLL** – Exploit for MS14-068 (Kerberos Checksum Vulnerability). MS14-068 is a famous *privilege escalation* in Active Directory: a domain user could forge a Kerberos ticket granting Domain Admin rights (Golden Ticket attack). EskimoRoll would automate crafting forged PAC signatures to impersonate any user. **Status:** Patched in 2014 (MS14-068) – but extremely powerful if a domain had been left unpatched. Even though this bug was publicly known, having the NSA’s exploit implementation (likely more streamlined) was a gift to penetration testers and attackers.
  * **ERRATICGOPHER** – An SMB exploit for Windows NT/2000/XP (pre-Vista). Likely it exploits an *older SMBv1 overflow* from early 2000s (possibly MS06-040 or similar). The mnemonic listing suggests it’s an SMBv1 RCE with no CVE given (meaning a known-old one or an unpatched one for legacy). This tool would be effective only on outdated systems. **Status:** Windows XP and 2000 are EOL; no new patches. It underscores Equation Group’s library included exploits going back many years for use in legacy environments.

Additionally, many **implants/backdoors** were in the Jan 2017 drop. These are malware that would be placed on Windows after exploiting it:

* **DanderSpritz (Early Modules):** It’s believed some components of the *DanderSpritz* post-exploitation toolkit were part of this leak (or at least referenced). DanderSpritz is a full-featured RAT/control suite (revealed fully in April), but the Jan dump might have contained early plugins or documentation. For example, **DarkPulsar**, a stealth Windows backdoor implant, was likely included or alluded to. DarkPulsar is a payload that provides low-level backdoor access and was later found on some systems by Kaspersky (in 2018) attributed to this leak. It hooks into the Windows OS at a kernel level, and **Oddjob**/DanderSpritz could remotely issue commands to it. **Status:** DarkPulsar was never patched (because it’s malware, not a vulnerability) – Kaspersky released detection signatures for it.

* **FUZZBUNCH** – Interestingly, **Fuzzbunch**, the Equation Group’s equivalent of Metasploit, was likely **withheld** until April. The January leak didn’t explicitly mention Fuzzbunch (the focus was on the dump of tools, not the framework). However, by then the security community suspected an exploit framework existed, due to references in tool output. Fuzzbunch was revealed in April as the framework that *launches* these exploits on targets. So in Jan, attackers got the individual binaries; in April, they got the “launcher” and the newer exploits.

**Effect and Reception:** Microsoft took the January Shadow Brokers dump seriously. They quietly analyzed the leaked Windows tools and found that *none of the exploits worked on currently supported Windows versions* (Windows 7 and up, or Exchange 2010 and up). Indeed, *three exploits* were left unpatched because Microsoft couldn’t reproduce them on supported systems: these were later revealed as **EnglishmanDentist**, **EsteemAudit**, and **ExplodingCan** (all of which targeted legacy systems – see next section). For everything else, patches already existed or were issued in March 2017. This proactive analysis is why, when the big April leak hit, Microsoft had *already patched* most of the critical holes a month prior (an *extraordinary* move suggesting they were warned, possibly by the NSA, of what was coming).

Security experts noted that while the January release didn’t introduce fresh Windows zero-days, it *validated NSA’s hand* in many past cyber operations. The tools lined up with Kaspersky’s earlier discoveries of Equation Group malware families. Furthermore, the availability of these implants and older exploits was a boon for red-teamers and criminals targeting out-of-date systems. For instance, **EsteemAudit** (the RDP exploit for XP/2003) was quickly picked up by penetration testers since many embedded systems still ran Windows XP in 2017.

In summary, the Jan 2017 “farewell” leak dumped a treasure trove of NSA Windows malware—providing 58+ tools/exploits as a public resource. While most were mitigated by then, the leak served as a prelude to the far more damaging April release, and gave defenders a heads-up to fortify legacy systems or finally decommission them. As Shadow Brokers themselves taunted, this was a *last-ditch effort* to show the value of their goods. Little did the world know, the most notorious exploits (e.g. EternalBlue) were *still* to come.

## April 2017 “Lost in Translation” Leak (Good Friday Dumps)

On April 14, 2017 (Good Friday), the Shadow Brokers unleashed their **most consequential leak**, dubbed by researchers as “Lost in Translation.” It consisted of multiple encrypted archives (the passwords were released or guessed), containing about 300 MB of NSA hacking tools. This leak included:

1. **Windows Exploits and Frameworks** – a suite of Equation Group exploits targeting *multiple versions of Windows* (from Windows XP up to Windows 8/Server 2012) and the **FUZZBUNCH** exploit framework to deploy them. Many of these exploits were *zero-day at the time for older systems* or had only been patched a month earlier in March 2017.
2. **Post-exploitation Implants** – tools like **DoublePulsar** (a backdoor) and **DanderSpritz** (a full malware control framework) used *after* initial compromise.
3. **SWIFT Banking Network Files** – operation notes, scripts, and data showing NSA’s infiltration of the SWIFT financial network in the Middle East. This included server logs and configurations from a Dubai-based SWIFT service bureau (EastNets), lists of compromised banking servers, and a tool for Oracle databases (PassFreely, previously discussed) for manipulating financial records.
4. **UNIX/Linux Exploits** – exploits and implants for Unix systems (Solaris, Linux) and older applications (e.g. web servers, mail servers). For example, **EXTREMEPARR** (Solaris dtappgather exploit) and **EASYBEE** (an exploit for IBM Lotus Notes SMTP). There were also kernel implants and *anti-forensic tools* for Unix (to hide NSA’s presence on compromised Linux servers).

Below is a summary table of *major exploits* from the April 2017 dump, their targets, and status:

| **Exploit (Codename)**         | **Target / Vulnerability**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Technical Details & CVE**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Patch Status**                                                                                                                                                                           | **Notable Use**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

**Table: Key Shadow Brokers “Lost in Translation” Windows exploits and their impact.** *(Note: MS17-010 patched EternalBlue/EternalChampion/EternalSynergy/EternalRomance vulnerabilities on supported Windows versions on March 14, 2017, one month *before* the leak.)*

As seen above, the April 2017 leak was **devastating** because it dropped multiple *wormable* Windows exploits into the public domain at once. Within weeks, hackers re-purposed these:

* **WannaCry** (May 12, 2017) – A ransomware worm that incorporated EternalBlue to spread autonomously. WannaCry infected 230,000+ computers in over 150 countries by exploiting SMBv1, encrypting files and demanding Bitcoin ransom. It also used DoublePulsar to propagate after the initial exploit. WannaCry’s outbreak caused hospitals in the UK to turn away patients and disrupted companies worldwide. This attack directly leveraged the Shadow Brokers leak – **Matthew Hickey** noted it put “cyber weapons in the hands of anyone”.

* **NotPetya**/“Nyetya” (June 27, 2017) – Another destructive worm (initially via a poisoned Ukrainian accounting software update) that used EternalBlue and EternalRomance to rapidly spread in internal networks. NotPetya masqueraded as ransomware but was a wiper, causing an estimated \$10 billion in damages globally (Maersk, Merck, etc. were hit hard). The inclusion of the SMB exploits from the leak made it far more virulent than it otherwise would have been.

* **Adoption by botnets & APTs:** In the months after, criminal groups integrated EternalBlue into mining botnets, and nation-state actors (outside the Equation Group) also used the leaked tools. E.g., North Korea’s Lazarus Group reportedly tested PassFreely to manipulate SWIFT transactions, and cryptojacking malware wormed through networks via EternalBlue well into 2018. Over **200,000 machines** were found to be backdoored by DoublePulsar in April 2017, mere weeks after the leak, indicating multiple actors scanning and exploiting systems en masse.

From a **technical standpoint**, the April leak gave security researchers an unprecedented look at NSA’s tactics. Tools like **Fuzzbunch** were dissected – Fuzzbunch is a slick, menu-driven framework similar to Metasploit, which allowed an operator to select an exploit (like EternalBlue), configure options, and deploy it, then automatically inject a payload (like DoublePulsar). Fuzzbunch even included a *plug-in architecture* for post-exploitation – basically Equation Group’s internal “Metasploit+Meterpreter.” The leak of DanderSpritz (an Equation Group modular implant platform) was equally eye-opening: DanderSpritz included dozens of plugins (for anything from capturing screenshots, to keystroke logging, to pivoting) and even a GUI called **“DanderSpritz Wizard”**. In 2017, this level of malware sophistication was mostly theoretical to outsiders; the leak proved it and provided source-like binaries to learn from. In fact, a GitHub repository and project sprung up to document DanderSpritz’s capabilities for the community.

**SWIFT Network Intrusion:** Perhaps the most politically significant part of the April release was evidence of the NSA’s espionage in Middle Eastern banks. The leak included an archive code-named **JEEPFLEA\_MARKET**, containing files from EastNets, a SWIFT service bureau in Dubai. This revealed that the NSA had **implanted keyloggers and obtained administrator credentials** on servers facilitating SWIFT transactions in Kuwait, Dubai, Qatar, Yemen and more. One spreadsheet in the leak listed *dozens of bank servers by IP, with notes like “Box has been implanted and we are collecting”*. In other words, the NSA had a “God’s eye” view into these banks’ financial flows. The **PassFreely tool** discussed earlier was part of this operation – by patching Oracle memory, the NSA could query SWIFT message databases at will. Another tool named **JASPER** was referenced, likely relating to parsing SWIFT message formats or exfiltrating transaction batches. The reaction was swift (no pun intended): SWIFT issued statements that its core network wasn’t compromised but acknowledged local bureau breaches. Banks in the region were alarmed that even *ally* intelligence agencies had been silently monitoring their transactions. This part of the leak, while less “wormable,” underscored the geopolitical impact – it was compared to “finding the NSA’s smoking gun” in financial surveillance, causing diplomatic discomfort for the US.

**Aftermath and Patches:** Microsoft had already patched the SMB flaws in MS17-010 ahead of the leak, which was fortuitous (amid speculation of an NSA warning or leak). However, seeing the functional exploits led to *urgent* action: in an extraordinary move, Microsoft released special patches for end-of-life systems (Windows XP, Vista, Server 2003) on May 13, 2017. This was one day after WannaCry hit – illustrating how dire the situation was. Similarly, in June 2017 Microsoft patched older IIS and RDP issues (ExplodingCan, EsteemAudit) that Shadow Brokers had exposed. These retrospective patches were highly unusual, basically acknowledging that the Shadow Brokers leak had armed too many bad actors with NSA’s weapons, forcing Microsoft to bend its EOL policies.

**Summary:** The Shadow Brokers’ comprehensive dump in April 2017 *dramatically shifted the cyber threat landscape*. Never before had such potent nation-state exploits been released at scale. It *validated* long-suspected NSA codenames (e.g., “EternalBlue” was even name-checked in an NSA document revealed by Snowden, and now here it was for anyone to use). The leak also sparked debate on the **Vulnerabilities Equities Process (VEP)** – critics argued that NSA’s hoarding of these exploits (instead of disclosing to vendors) ultimately harmed the public when the tools leaked. The NSA faced intense scrutiny but officially declined to comment on the authenticity of the leaks.

In the months after, **Shadow Brokers themselves claimed to retire** – though they briefly returned to advertise a “monthly subscription service” for new exploits in mid-2017. They hinted at having tools for Windows 10, mobile OS, and more SWIFT data. However, no significant further leaks occurred from them. It’s widely suspected the group was connected to Russian intelligence (given the leaks’ timing around U.S. elections and their fluent knowledge of NSA ops), though definitive attribution remains unproven.

In conclusion, the Shadow Brokers’ leaks (Equation Group firewall tools, Windows exploits “Lost in Translation,” and the SWIFT spy data) collectively represent one of the most significant security incidents in history. They exposed nearly **every major cyber tool** from NSA’s arsenal up to 2013 – from router implants and VPN exploits to Windows worms and banking trojans. For each tool and exploit, we’ve seen its function, target, technical workings, patch status, and in many cases its real-world legacy (from hospital ransomware to bank espionage). These leaks forced the cybersecurity community to rapidly patch systems, update rules to detect NSA tools, and fundamentally rethink the implications of government stockpiling of 0-days. As one researcher aptly put it, this was “*the most damaging release… the most powerful cache of exploits ever made public*” – truly translating NSA’s once-secret capabilities into tools available to hackers across the globe, for better or worse.

**Sources:** The information above is drawn from analyses by security researchers and news outlets at the time of the leaks. For example, Mustafa Al-Bassam’s breakdown of the August 2016 dump provided a full catalogue of the firewall exploits and implants. Cisco’s security team confirmed and detailed specific exploits like EXTRABACON and EPICBANANA (CVE-2016-6366 and 6367). Microsoft’s Security Response Center blog and emergency advisories in April–June 2017 described which Shadow Broker exploits were already patched and which weren’t reproducible on current systems. The *Rapid7* and *Mnemonic* threat intelligence blogs in April 2017 gave technical rundowns of the Windows exploits and their CVEs. Notably, media outlets like *Wired* and *Threatpost* reported how the leak revealed NSA’s SWIFT spying (hacking EastNets), and how hackers repurposed the SMB exploits for WannaCry. All these sources collectively paint the full picture of each tool’s origin, mechanics, and impact.
