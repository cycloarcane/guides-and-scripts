**CUDA Compatibility:** All listed GPUs are part of NVIDIA’s RTX 30/40-series and fully support CUDA for AI workloads. For example, the RTX 4060 (Laptop GPU) provides **8 GB of GDDR6 VRAM** and thousands of CUDA cores (Compute Capability 8.7) for acceleration of machine learning tasks. These GPUs are *CUDA-capable* and work with NVIDIA’s Linux drivers and CUDA toolkit out of the box. The user’s desktop RTX 3090 has 24 GB VRAM; while no sub-£1000 laptop matches that, **8 GB** is the highest available in this price range and is sufficient for many inference tasks (with appropriate model optimizations).

**Linux Compatibility Notes:** All models come with Windows by default, but are known to run Linux with some configuration:

* **NVIDIA Drivers:** You will need to install NVIDIA’s proprietary drivers for CUDA support. Secure Boot may need to be disabled or DKMS modules signed to load these drivers on Linux. Once installed, the CUDA toolkit can leverage the RTX GPU for compute.

* **Hybrid Graphics / MUX:** These laptops use hybrid GPU setups (integrated GPU + NVIDIA). Most have a MUX switch or BIOS option for “discrete GPU only” mode, which can simplify Linux setup by bypassing NVIDIA Optimus. For example, the MSI Katana 15 explicitly supports a *“discrete graphics mode”* (MUX) to run the RTX 4060 directly. If a MUX is not available, you can still use NVIDIA Optimus on Linux (e.g. via `prime-run` or switching to NVIDIA-only mode with NVIDIA’s utilities).

* **Kernel Support:** Newer CPUs and GPUs may require an updated kernel and drivers. In some cases, early Linux users reported issues on hybrid systems (especially AMD CPU + NVIDIA GPU combos) – e.g. a Lenovo LOQ user noted crashes with the default Debian kernel and had to use newer kernels for stability. However, such issues **have fixes**: using a current distro (kernel 6.x) or a distro like Fedora/Ubuntu 23.04+ generally resolves boot and driver problems. Community forums indicate these laptops can run Linux well after tweaking drivers and settings.

* **Peripherals and Other Hardware:** Core components (CPU, GPU, RAM, NVMe) work on Linux. Common *gotchas* may be Wi-Fi or RGB keyboard control. Most of these models use Intel or Realtek Wi-Fi; ensure you have the firmware package (e.g. `linux-firmware`) installed. Keyboard backlighting and special function keys might require vendor-specific modules (for instance, MSI laptops can use the `msi-ec` kernel module for full fan/RGB control). These are not show-stoppers, just additional steps for a polished setup.

In summary, each listed laptop provides a **CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU with 8 GB VRAM**, making them suitable for AI inference on the go. They are **within a £1000 budget** and have been used with Linux by the community. With manual driver installation and minor tweaks (e.g. enabling discrete-GPU mode or installing kernel updates), **Arch Linux + KDE** should run smoothly on these machines. All the NVIDIA GPUs listed are supported by CUDA and PyTorch/TensorFlow, so you can leverage them much like your desktop RTX 3090 – albeit with a smaller VRAM capacity.

**Sources:** Recent retailer listings and user reports were used to verify specifications, pricing, and Linux compatibility insights. Each model’s GPU (RTX 4060) is confirmed to have 8 GB VRAM and support CUDA. Linux installation on these laptops has been documented by the community, with workarounds available for initial hurdles.
