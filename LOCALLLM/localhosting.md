Got it. I’ll search for options for running LLMs locally on NVIDIA hardware, specifically targeting all-in-one packages that include voice-to-text, text-to-voice, web search, file uploads, and formatted code blocks — suitable for use as a personalized assistant. I'll prioritize setups that minimize dependency issues (compared to oobabooga) and can handle 30B models in 4-bit quantization. I'll let you know what I find shortly.

# Best Local LLM Assistant Solutions on Arch Linux (NVIDIA GPU)

Arch Linux users with NVIDIA GPUs have several options to run large language models (LLMs) locally for a personal AI assistant. Below we outline 5 top projects that provide an all-in-one setup with voice input/output, search capabilities, document handling, and code-friendly outputs. Each option is evaluated for features, strengths, limitations, installation ease, and development status.

## Open WebUI (Formerly Ollama WebUI)  
Open WebUI is a **user-friendly AI chat interface** that integrates *everything* in one package. It supports local LLMs (via Ollama or direct GPU backends) alongside a rich set of tools and plugins. This web-based UI was built to replicate and extend ChatGPT-like functionality on your own machine.

- **Integrated Features:** Provides full Markdown support (renders formatted code blocks) and even built-in voice/video chat integration for hands-free conversations ([GitHub - open-webui/open-webui: User-friendly AI Interface (Supports Ollama, OpenAI API, ...)](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui#:~:text=,LaTeX%20capabilities%20for%20enriched%20interaction)). It supports retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by letting you load documents or files into a chat and query them, and it can perform live web searches to inject up-to-date information ([GitHub - open-webui/open-webui: User-friendly AI Interface (Supports Ollama, OpenAI API, ...)](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui#:~:text=,command%20before%20a%20query)). It also offers image generation and multi-model chat within the same interface ([GitHub - open-webui/open-webui: User-friendly AI Interface (Supports Ollama, OpenAI API, ...)](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui#:~:text=,enabling%20seamless%20integration%20with%20LLMs)) ([GitHub - open-webui/open-webui: User-friendly AI Interface (Supports Ollama, OpenAI API, ...)](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui#:~:text=OpenAI%27s%20DALL,experience%20with%20dynamic%20visual%20content)). In short, it covers all required features: speech-to-text, text-to-speech, web search, file Q&A, and rich text outputs.  
- **Strengths:** Extremely feature-rich and extensible. Open WebUI can combine local models with API-based models (OpenAI, etc.) and supports large quantized models on GPU – it has a special Docker image with CUDA support for running models efficiently ([GitHub - open-webui/open-webui: User-friendly AI Interface (Supports Ollama, OpenAI API, ...)](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui#:~:text=,tagged%20images)). The UI is polished (responsive design and even a PWA for mobile) and supports multiple users/roles if needed. Despite the many capabilities, it remains offline-first (you choose if/when to use online services). Active development is ongoing, with a roadmap and “dev” branch for cutting-edge features ([GitHub - open-webui/open-webui: User-friendly AI Interface (Supports Ollama, OpenAI API, ...)](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui#:~:text=The%20,have%20bugs%20or%20incomplete%20features)).  
- **Limitations:** The extensive feature set means it’s a heavier solution. It requires more resources – running a 30B model in 4-bit still needs a strong GPU (20GB+ VRAM) or will be very slow. The Docker image is large, and initial setup (downloading models, configuring search APIs or keys) can take time. Also, with so many features, there may be occasional bugs on the newest functions (the project is relatively new and evolving fast). However, stability for core chat functionality is generally good.  
- **Installation:** **Easy** – Open WebUI emphasizes one-line deployment via Docker or Kubernetes for a “hassle-free experience” ([GitHub - open-webui/open-webui: User-friendly AI Interface (Supports Ollama, OpenAI API, ...)](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui#:~:text=Key%20Features%20of%20Open%20WebUI,%E2%AD%90)). Simply pulling the Docker image (either CPU/Ollama based or `:cuda` for GPU ([GitHub - open-webui/open-webui: User-friendly AI Interface (Supports Ollama, OpenAI API, ...)](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui#:~:text=,tagged%20images))) will get you a running web service. There’s also documentation for manual setup if you prefer. Arch users can use Docker (or Podman) which isolates dependencies and avoids Python package conflicts. The web UI runs on localhost; no complex configuration needed unless you enable optional features like search (which might require an API key or a SearXNG instance).  
- **Development Status:** **Very active.** This project has a sizeable community (regular updates and issue reports) and even offers an enterprise edition. It’s open-source (BSD-3-Clause) ([GitHub - open-webui/open-webui: User-friendly AI Interface (Supports Ollama, OpenAI API, ...)](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui#:~:text=User,OpenAI%20API%2C)), with frequent commits. Given its popularity, you can expect continuous improvements and community support. It’s one of the most **comprehensive and stable** frameworks available for a local ChatGPT-like assistant.

## LoLLMS Web UI (Former GPT4All-UI by ParisNeo)  
LoLLMS Web UI is an **all-in-one chat interface** that focuses on running local models with a user-friendly front-end. It supports *multiple backend engines* and model formats, making it flexible for different hardware setups. You can chat with LLMs, use different “personality” profiles, and even generate images or other media via plugins. It’s a more modular and offline-first alternative to Oobabooga’s text-generation-webui, aimed at easier installs and stability.

- **Features:** LoLLMS Web UI supports a wide range of model types and sizes. It can load models via Hugging Face transformers, use GGML/GGUF quantized files, or run GPTQ 4-bit models via the EXLLama backend ([GitHub - ParisNeo/lollms-webui: Lord of Large Language and Multi modal Systems Web User Interface](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui#:~:text=,router%20service)). In the UI, you get chat history management, message editing, and rating, plus extras like Stable Diffusion image generation, music or video generation, etc., through integrated tools ([GitHub - ParisNeo/lollms-webui: Lord of Large Language and Multi modal Systems Web User Interface](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui#:~:text=,Copy%2C%20edit%2C%20and%20remove%20messages)). It even has a rudimentary search function and can be extended with *binding* plugins for things like web search or data organization (the project mentions “searching, data organization” as possible functions) ([GitHub - ParisNeo/lollms-webui: Lord of Large Language and Multi modal Systems Web User Interface](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui#:~:text=,up%2Fdown%20rating%20for%20generated%20answers)). Markdown formatting is supported for responses, so code blocks will display properly. 
- **Strengths:** **Versatile and stable.** LoLLMS is built to accommodate whatever model you have – from a small CPU-friendly model to a 30B 4-bit model on GPU. For example, it supports ExLlama v2 for GPTQ, which is ideal for running 30B+ models with 4-bit quantization on CUDA GPUs ([GitHub - ParisNeo/lollms-webui: Lord of Large Language and Multi modal Systems Web User Interface](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui#:~:text=,router%20service)). This means an NVIDIA card can be utilized fully. The interface is clean (with light/dark modes) and stores your conversations locally for continuity. It also allows *personalities* (pre-defined system prompts/behaviors) to customize the assistant’s style. Installation is simpler than Oobabooga’s; a one-click installer script or even a Docker container is provided ([GitHub - ParisNeo/lollms-webui: Lord of Large Language and Multi modal Systems Web User Interface](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui#:~:text=,vllm%20service)). The project has **4.6k+ stars on GitHub** and an active community, indicating robust development and community-tested reliability ([GitHub - ParisNeo/lollms-webui: Lord of Large Language and Multi modal Systems Web User Interface](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui#:~:text=4,Tags%20%20%20Activity)).  
- **Limitations:** Out-of-the-box, it’s primarily a text-based chat UI. Unlike Open WebUI, it doesn’t natively include speech recognition or TTS – you would have to run Whisper separately and paste input, or modify the source to add voice (there’s no built-in voice loop). Similarly, while it has the ability to search or do RAG with plugins, those may require some configuration and are not as seamless as in Open WebUI. Essentially, LoLLMS aims to be a solid foundation; some advanced assistant features (web browsing, etc.) might need additional setup or are still experimental. Another consideration is that the multi-modal features (image/video generation) can add to the “dependency hell” if you enable them all at once – however, you can opt not to install those parts.  
- **Installation:** **Straightforward.** The project provides an installer script for Linux (`lollms_installer.sh`) which sets up a Python 3.11 virtual env and all requirements automatically ([GitHub - ParisNeo/lollms-webui: Lord of Large Language and Multi modal Systems Web User Interface](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui#:~:text=Automatic%20installation%20)) ([GitHub - ParisNeo/lollms-webui: Lord of Large Language and Multi modal Systems Web User Interface](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui#:~:text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.python.org%2Fdownloads%2Frelease%2Fpython)). This avoids the manual dependency juggling. Arch users can use this script (after installing base Python 3.11). Alternatively, manual installation is documented – essentially cloning the repo and pip-installing requirements ([GitHub - ParisNeo/lollms-webui: Lord of Large Language and Multi modal Systems Web User Interface](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui#:~:text=4)). Docker support is noted, so you might find a community-provided container as well. Overall, it’s much easier than assembling a webui with many extensions; LoLLMS comes pre-integrated.  
- **Development Status:** **Active and community-driven.** LoLLMS (formerly GPT4All-UI) is under continuous development by its maintainer (ParisNeo) and contributors. The project is open-source (MIT license) and sees frequent updates and fixes. Because it consolidates efforts to support lots of model formats, it tends to quickly adopt improvements (e.g., new quantization methods or new model releases). You can find support and documentation on their GitHub and Wiki. Given its popularity in the self-hosted AI community, it’s a reliable choice that balances functionality with stability.

## Verbi – Modular Voice Assistant (Python)  
Verbi is a **modular voice-to-voice assistant framework** for those who want a customizable setup. It isn’t a polished GUI app, but rather a Python project that *orchestrates speech recognition, an LLM, and speech synthesis*. Verbi lets you mix and match APIs or local models for each component, which is great for experimenting. An Arch user comfortable with Python will find it a powerful base to build a personal Jarvis-like assistant.

- **Features:** Verbi’s design is highly modular. You can choose different providers for transcription, generation, and TTS via a config file. For example, you might use local Whisper or an API like Deepgram for speech-to-text, then a local LLM via Ollama (or even OpenAI’s API) for the brain, and finally Coqui’s TTS or ElevenLabs for the voice output ([GitHub - PromtEngineer/Verbi: A modular voice assistant application for experimenting with state-of-the-art transcription, response generation, and text-to-speech models. Supports OpenAI, Groq, Elevanlabs, CartesiaAI, and Deepgram APIs, plus local models via Ollama. Ideal for research and development in voice technology.](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/Verbi#:~:text=A%20modular%20voice%20assistant%20application,and%20development%20in%20voice%20technology)) ([GitHub - PromtEngineer/Verbi: A modular voice assistant application for experimenting with state-of-the-art transcription, response generation, and text-to-speech models. Supports OpenAI, Groq, Elevanlabs, CartesiaAI, and Deepgram APIs, plus local models via Ollama. Ideal for research and development in voice technology.](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/Verbi#:~:text=,for%20easy%20setup%20and%20management)). It comes with a command-line interface that records audio from your microphone and then plays back the assistant’s spoken response ([GitHub - PromtEngineer/Verbi: A modular voice assistant application for experimenting with state-of-the-art transcription, response generation, and text-to-speech models. Supports OpenAI, Groq, Elevanlabs, CartesiaAI, and Deepgram APIs, plus local models via Ollama. Ideal for research and development in voice technology.](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/Verbi#:~:text=,for%20easy%20setup%20and%20management)). Because of its modularity, Verbi can indeed run **fully locally** – using Ollama for the LLM and Piper or Coqui TTS for voice – or leverage cloud services if you prefer better accuracy for STT/TTS. The key idea is flexibility for research and development in voice AI.  
- **Strengths:** The flexibility is the biggest strength. Verbi supports multiple APIs and local backends out-of-the-box, and switching is as simple as editing the `config.py` ([GitHub - PromtEngineer/Verbi: A modular voice assistant application for experimenting with state-of-the-art transcription, response generation, and text-to-speech models. Supports OpenAI, Groq, Elevanlabs, CartesiaAI, and Deepgram APIs, plus local models via Ollama. Ideal for research and development in voice technology.](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/Verbi#:~:text=5)). It supports **local models via Ollama** (which means you can run LLaMA-derived models on your PC) and local text-to-speech like Piper ([GitHub - PromtEngineer/Verbi: A modular voice assistant application for experimenting with state-of-the-art transcription, response generation, and text-to-speech models. Supports OpenAI, Groq, Elevanlabs, CartesiaAI, and Deepgram APIs, plus local models via Ollama. Ideal for research and development in voice technology.](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/Verbi#:~:text=A%20modular%20voice%20assistant%20application,and%20development%20in%20voice%20technology)). This modular approach means you can optimize for latency or quality as needed. Another strength is privacy – by using local components, you can ensure no data leaves your machine. As a Python-based tool, it’s relatively easy to extend (for example, one could add a web search tool by intercepting queries and using Python to fetch results, then feeding to the LLM). It’s also MIT-licensed and has ~900 stars on GitHub, indicating a growing user base and community interest ([GitHub - PromtEngineer/Verbi: A modular voice assistant application for experimenting with state-of-the-art transcription, response generation, and text-to-speech models. Supports OpenAI, Groq, Elevanlabs, CartesiaAI, and Deepgram APIs, plus local models via Ollama. Ideal for research and development in voice technology.](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/Verbi#:~:text=,Star%20969)).  
- **Limitations:** Verbi is not a turnkey application for end-users – it’s more of a *framework*. There is no graphical interface; you run it in a terminal. That means no formatted text output (you’ll just see plain text transcripts of what the assistant says) and no rich text like code formatting. There’s also **no built-in knowledge ingestion or web browsing** in the default setup – the assistant’s knowledge is limited to the LLM’s training data (unless you connect it to a vector DB or tools manually). While it supports local models, it relies on **Ollama** to serve those models; this adds an extra step (running the Ollama server and pulling models). GPU acceleration for the LLM will depend on Ollama’s support (which currently is primarily CPU-focused for Linux). So performance with a 30B model might be quite slow unless you have made Ollama use some GPU offloading. Finally, being a smaller project, the documentation is limited to the README, and you may need to troubleshoot or read the source to fully understand all options.  
- **Installation:** **Moderate.** Verbi doesn’t have a one-click installer, but setup is straightforward for a developer. You clone the repository and install the Python requirements ([GitHub - PromtEngineer/Verbi: A modular voice assistant application for experimenting with state-of-the-art transcription, response generation, and text-to-speech models. Supports OpenAI, Groq, Elevanlabs, CartesiaAI, and Deepgram APIs, plus local models via Ollama. Ideal for research and development in voice technology.](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/Verbi#:~:text=3)) ([GitHub - PromtEngineer/Verbi: A modular voice assistant application for experimenting with state-of-the-art transcription, response generation, and text-to-speech models. Supports OpenAI, Groq, Elevanlabs, CartesiaAI, and Deepgram APIs, plus local models via Ollama. Ideal for research and development in voice technology.](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/Verbi#:~:text=3)). You’ll need to have Python 3.10+ and possibly set up environment variables for any API keys you use ([GitHub - PromtEngineer/Verbi: A modular voice assistant application for experimenting with state-of-the-art transcription, response generation, and text-to-speech models. Supports OpenAI, Groq, Elevanlabs, CartesiaAI, and Deepgram APIs, plus local models via Ollama. Ideal for research and development in voice technology.](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/Verbi#:~:text=4,environment%20variables)). If you plan to use local STT/TTS like Whisper or Piper, you may need to install those models or binaries separately (e.g., download a Whisper model). For the LLM, installing **Ollama** is required (Ollama provides a convenient way to run local models; on Arch you might use their official binary or Docker image since there’s no pacman package). Configuration is done in a single file (`config.py`) where you select “local” or “openai” etc. for each component ([GitHub - PromtEngineer/Verbi: A modular voice assistant application for experimenting with state-of-the-art transcription, response generation, and text-to-speech models. Supports OpenAI, Groq, Elevanlabs, CartesiaAI, and Deepgram APIs, plus local models via Ollama. Ideal for research and development in voice technology.](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/Verbi#:~:text=Edit%20config,models%20you%20want%20to%20use)). The process is not as simple as running a Docker container, but it’s far from “dependency hell” – mostly just moving pieces to put together. 
- **Development Status:** **Active (medium-sized project).** Verbi was released in mid-2023 and has seen updates and a tutorial video series. With nearly 1k stars and some community forks, it’s under active development by its creator (GitHub user PromtEngineer) and contributors. It’s positioned as a research tool, so expect that as new SOTA models for STT or TTS come out, you might need to integrate them manually. The upside is that Verbi’s modular nature will likely keep it relevant – you can plug in new models without waiting for a developer to rewrite the whole app. If you’re comfortable with Python, Verbi offers an excellent balance between using pre-built components and coding your own extensions.

## June – Local Voice Chatbot (Whisper + Ollama + Coqui)  
June is a **lightweight local voice assistant** that runs entirely offline, prioritizing simplicity and privacy. It’s essentially a command-line tool that uses Whisper for speech recognition, a local LLM (via Ollama) for generating responses, and Coqui TTS for speaking those responses. If you want a quick way to chat with a local model by voice, June provides a minimalistic solution.

- **Features:** June combines three main pieces: Hugging Face Transformers (specifically OpenAI’s Whisper model) for converting your speech to text, an LLM served by Ollama to produce a reply, and the Coqui TTS toolkit to turn the reply into spoken audio ([GitHub - mezbaul-h/june: Local voice chatbot for engaging conversations, powered by Ollama, Hugging Face Transformers, and  Coqui TTS Toolkit](https://github.com/mezbaul-h/june#:~:text=june%20is%20a%20local%20voice,assisted%20interactions%20on)). It runs as a terminal program (a Python CLI), where you trigger the voice recording (e.g., by pressing a key), and it will transcribe your question, get the answer from the LLM, and then play it back via your speakers. By default, it uses an 8-billion-parameter Llama 2 variant quantized to 4-bit (provided as `llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_0` in Ollama) ([GitHub - mezbaul-h/june: Local voice chatbot for engaging conversations, powered by Ollama, Hugging Face Transformers, and  Coqui TTS Toolkit](https://github.com/mezbaul-h/june#:~:text=Pull%20the%20language%20model%20,first%2C%20if%20you%20haven%27t%20already)), but you can instruct Ollama to use any model you have – potentially a 30B 4-bit model – since June just sends your prompt to the Ollama server. It’s a self-contained voice chatbot focused on conversation (no fancy plugins or GUI).  
- **Strengths:** **Very minimal and privacy-focused.** There are no external API calls – all processing is local ([GitHub - mezbaul-h/june: Local voice chatbot for engaging conversations, powered by Ollama, Hugging Face Transformers, and  Coqui TTS Toolkit](https://github.com/mezbaul-h/june#:~:text=june%20is%20a%20local%20voice,assisted%20interactions%20on)). This means even voice data stays on your PC. The architecture is simple, so there are fewer things to go wrong: if Whisper transcribes and the LLM responds, it will work. June leverages proven libraries (HF Transformers and Coqui) rather than custom code for ML, which reduces maintenance issues. For an Arch user, using system-installed Python and pip for dependencies is familiar territory. Another strength is that by relying on Ollama, it inherits a lot of flexibility: you can swap in different LLM models by just changing an environment variable or config (for instance, to try a bigger model if you have more RAM). The **resource requirements** can be tailored via model choice – use a smaller model for faster responses or a larger one for smarter answers.  
- **Limitations:** In exchange for simplicity, June foregoes many features. **No web search or document ingestion** is available – the assistant can only answer from its built-in knowledge (the model’s training data). If you ask it to look something up or read a file, it cannot actually do that. There’s also no persistent memory beyond the chat context; it doesn’t integrate a vector store or long-term memory. Being a terminal app, **formatted output is limited** – it will print text answers to the console and speak them, but things like code blocks or tables won’t be richly formatted (you’d just see plain text in the terminal). Additionally, running larger models is possible but may be impractical: Ollama (which uses llama.cpp under the hood) on Linux is mostly CPU-bound. Even though it can load a 30B 4-bit model, the inference might be extremely slow without GPU acceleration. So while “slow inference is acceptable” to you, this could mean truly **slow** (multiple seconds per word). To use the NVIDIA GPU, you’d have to wait for future Ollama updates or use a different backend. Lastly, June’s development is relatively small-scale – with under 100 commits and no open issues on GitHub, it seems to “just work,” but also might not see frequent new features or bug fixes unless the author resumes work.  
- **Installation:** **Manual but simple.** You need to install **Ollama** separately (Ollama provides an .AppImage for Linux and likely works on Arch; if not, a Docker or building from source is an option). Once Ollama is running and you’ve pulled a model for it, installing June itself is just a matter of `git clone` and running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The requirements include Transformers and Coqui TTS. On Arch, you might need system packages for PortAudio or other audio I/O (since Coqui TTS or sounddevice might rely on them). After installation, you launch the app (`june-va` command) and it starts listening. There’s a config file where you can set the model name/tag you want to use with Ollama, and other parameters ([GitHub - mezbaul-h/june: Local voice chatbot for engaging conversations, powered by Ollama, Hugging Face Transformers, and  Coqui TTS Toolkit](https://github.com/mezbaul-h/june#:~:text=Pull%20the%20language%20model%20,first%2C%20if%20you%20haven%27t%20already)). There is no Docker for June, but its dependency list is modest (the biggest being the machine learning models themselves). All in all, an Arch user versed in Python should set it up within an hour or so.  
- **Development Status:** **Small, single-contributor project.** June was released in mid-2023 and has about 700+ stars on GitHub ([GitHub - mezbaul-h/june: Local voice chatbot for engaging conversations, powered by Ollama, Hugging Face Transformers, and  Coqui TTS Toolkit](https://github.com/mezbaul-h/june#:~:text=,Star%20764)) – indicating quite a few people have tried it and found it useful. It’s relatively stable for what it does; since there aren’t many moving parts, there haven’t been many updates needed. It’s not as actively developed as the large web UIs, but the flip side is it doesn’t need much maintenance once it’s working. If something breaks (e.g., due to a new version of a library), you might have to fix it yourself given the low activity. However, because it sticks to standard libraries, breakage is unlikely. In summary, June is a good option if you want *just* a voice-enabled local ChatGPT and nothing more – it’s lean and gets the job done without dragging in a ton of dependencies.

## GPT4All Voice Assistant (Offline Voice AI by Ai-Austin)  
GPT4All-Voice-Assistant is an open-source project that turns **Nomic’s GPT4All** local models into a voice-based assistant. It’s very similar in concept to June – offline Whisper, local LLM, and TTS – but specifically tailored to the GPT4All ecosystem and with an aim for continuous background listening (like a smart speaker). This project is accompanied by a YouTube tutorial, making it approachable for those who prefer guided setup.

- **Features:** This assistant runs 100% offline, ensuring privacy ([GitHub - Ai-Austin/GPT4ALL-Voice-Assistant: This is a 100% offline GPT4ALL Voice Assistant. Completely open source and privacy friendly. Use any language model on GPT4ALL. Background process voice detection. Watch the full YouTube tutorial for setup guide: https://youtu.be/6zAk0KHmiGw](https://github.com/Ai-Austin/GPT4ALL-Voice-Assistant#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20100,be%2F6zAk0KHmiGw)). It uses a background process to listen for your voice (likely with a hotword or constant listening loop) and then responds with generated speech, effectively creating a hands-free voice chatbot. Under the hood, it uses Whisper for speech-to-text and GPT4All for the language model. GPT4All is a framework that allows running various LLMs (like LLaMA, MPT, etc. in quantized form) easily on local hardware. So you can choose any model that’s compatible with GPT4All (there are dozens, including 13B and some 30B 4-bit variants) and have the assistant use that for replies ([GitHub - Ai-Austin/GPT4ALL-Voice-Assistant: This is a 100% offline GPT4ALL Voice Assistant. Completely open source and privacy friendly. Use any language model on GPT4ALL. Background process voice detection. Watch the full YouTube tutorial for setup guide: https://youtu.be/6zAk0KHmiGw](https://github.com/Ai-Austin/GPT4ALL-Voice-Assistant#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20100,be%2F6zAk0KHmiGw)). The text-to-speech is handled by an offline TTS engine (possibly Coqui or similar – the exact TTS isn’t stated, but being fully offline implies an open-source TTS library is used). The result is an experience akin to an Alexa or Google Assistant, except all AI smarts are running locally.  
- **Strengths:** **Hands-free experience.** Unlike some other solutions that require push-to-talk or typing, GPT4All Voice Assistant is designed to be always listening for commands, which is ideal for a personal assistant you might install on a home machine or Raspberry Pi with a microphone. It’s completely open source and doesn’t send anything to the cloud ([GitHub - Ai-Austin/GPT4ALL-Voice-Assistant: This is a 100% offline GPT4ALL Voice Assistant. Completely open source and privacy friendly. Use any language model on GPT4ALL. Background process voice detection. Watch the full YouTube tutorial for setup guide: https://youtu.be/6zAk0KHmiGw](https://github.com/Ai-Austin/GPT4ALL-Voice-Assistant#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20100,be%2F6zAk0KHmiGw)), meaning it’s very privacy-friendly. The use of GPT4All means installation and model management is simplified (GPT4All provides one-click model downloads and has a unified interface for many model types). Also, GPT4All is known for being user-friendly, so if you’re not keen on dealing with Python venvs and dependencies, this might be slightly easier. The tutorial video by the author is a bonus, as it walks through setup steps, which can save time. In terms of supported models, GPT4All can run quite large models in 4-bit on CPU, so while slow, you **can** use a 30B parameter model if you’re patient, or stick to smaller ones for faster responses.  
- **Limitations:** Being a community project with ~180 stars, it’s still relatively **nascent**. You might encounter rough edges or need to tweak it for your specific audio hardware. The always-on listening, while a great feature, can be tricky to get right (background noise, false triggers, etc.). There’s no mention of a wake-word, so it might either listen continuously (using more CPU) or require a manual trigger – both approaches have trade-offs. Similar to June, this assistant doesn’t natively know how to use tools like web search or read local files. If you ask it factual questions, it’s limited by the knowledge of the model you chose. If you need it to have up-to-date info, you’d have to integrate a custom solution (not trivial for a beginner). Also, GPU acceleration: GPT4All core can use CPU or GPU, but many GPT4All model builds are CPU-focused (they run on llama.cpp). If you have a GPU, you might have to manually switch to a GPTQ model and a different runtime, which this project may not support out-of-the-box. So performance might be slower than a specialized GPU-centric UI like Open WebUI or LoLLMS.  
- **Installation:** **Guided (video).** The author provides a YouTube video detailing how to set it up, which implies the process is moderately involved but doable. Typically, you would need to install Python and the GPT4All Python bindings or CLI. There’s likely a need to install PortAudio or similar for microphone access, and FFMPEG for audio playback. Then you’d clone the repository and follow the instructions (possibly running a setup script). Since it’s all Python, Arch Linux can handle it as long as you install the required libraries (which may be in AUR or via pip). The mention of “background process voice detection” ([GitHub - Ai-Austin/GPT4ALL-Voice-Assistant: This is a 100% offline GPT4ALL Voice Assistant. Completely open source and privacy friendly. Use any language model on GPT4ALL. Background process voice detection. Watch the full YouTube tutorial for setup guide: https://youtu.be/6zAk0KHmiGw](https://github.com/Ai-Austin/GPT4ALL-Voice-Assistant#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20100,be%2F6zAk0KHmiGw)) suggests it might set up a loop or daemon – possibly you’d run a script that stays running to monitor the mic. Managing that (ensuring it starts on boot, etc.) would be up to you. The good news is GPT4All has precompiled binaries, so you won’t need to compile the model code yourself. Overall, expect a bit of tinkering during install (especially with audio devices), but with the video guide, it should be manageable.  
- **Development Status:** **Up-and-coming.** This project is essentially a demonstration by a developer (Ai-Austin) and is not (yet) backed by a large community. It’s open-source MIT, so others could contribute. Given the interest in voice assistants, it may gain traction. Right now, it’s a small repository, so support will mainly be through the video or the GitHub README. If you are comfortable being an early adopter and perhaps doing minor troubleshooting, it’s a fine choice. Otherwise, for more established projects, one of the above options might be safer. That said, because it leverages the GPT4All ecosystem, it benefits indirectly from improvements in GPT4All, which is quite active. Any advances in GPT4All (like better quantization or new models) immediately become available to this voice assistant.

**In summary**, if you want the most **comprehensive, plug-and-play solution**, **Open WebUI** is a top pick – it covers everything (voice, search, docs, code display) in one package ([GitHub - open-webui/open-webui: User-friendly AI Interface (Supports Ollama, OpenAI API, ...)](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui#:~:text=,command%20before%20a%20query)) ([GitHub - open-webui/open-webui: User-friendly AI Interface (Supports Ollama, OpenAI API, ...)](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui#:~:text=,LaTeX%20capabilities%20for%20enriched%20interaction)). For a slightly slimmer but still powerful interface focused on local use, **LoLLMS Web UI** is excellent, especially if you prioritize multi-model support and a stable UI over voice integration ([GitHub - ParisNeo/lollms-webui: Lord of Large Language and Multi modal Systems Web User Interface](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui#:~:text=,Copy%2C%20edit%2C%20and%20remove%20messages)) ([GitHub - ParisNeo/lollms-webui: Lord of Large Language and Multi modal Systems Web User Interface](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui#:~:text=,router%20service)). If you’re inclined to tinker and want full control, **Verbi** offers a modular path to build exactly the assistant you want, at the cost of some elbow grease in coding/configuration ([GitHub - PromtEngineer/Verbi: A modular voice assistant application for experimenting with state-of-the-art transcription, response generation, and text-to-speech models. Supports OpenAI, Groq, Elevanlabs, CartesiaAI, and Deepgram APIs, plus local models via Ollama. Ideal for research and development in voice technology.](https://github.com/PromtEngineer/Verbi#:~:text=A%20modular%20voice%20assistant%20application,and%20development%20in%20voice%20technology)) ([GitHub - PromtEngineer/Verbi: A modular voice assistant application for experimenting with state-of-the-art transcription, response generation, and text-to-speech models.

And for those who just want a simple voice assistant without spending days debugging Python environments, **June** or the **GPT4All Voice Assistant** provide minimalistic, self-contained setups that are comparatively easy to get running (no complex dependencies or web stack), though they lack advanced tools and may run slower ([GitHub - mezbaul-h/june: Local voice chatbot for engaging conversations, powered by Ollama, Hugging Face Transformers, and  Coqui TTS Toolkit](https://github.com/mezbaul-h/june#:~:text=june%20is%20a%20local%20voice,assisted%20interactions%20on)) ([GitHub - Ai-Austin/GPT4ALL-Voice-Assistant: This is a 100% offline GPT4ALL Voice Assistant.

All of these are compatible with Arch Linux – just make sure to have the NVIDIA drivers/CUDA set up if you plan to use GPU acceleration for the larger models. Each project is active in its own right, so you can expect updates and community support to improve the local LLM experience over time. Good luck with your personal AI assistant setup!
