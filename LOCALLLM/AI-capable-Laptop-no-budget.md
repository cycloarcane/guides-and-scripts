# High-VRAM Laptops for AI Inference (UK Availability 2025)

Below is a list of laptops (available for purchase or preorder in the UK) that offer the **maximum VRAM** currently found in mobile GPUs, making them suitable for high-performance AI inference on Arch Linux. All models feature **NVIDIA CUDA-compatible** GPUs (GeForce RTX 40-series or professional RTX Ada series) with **16 GB VRAM** – which is the upper limit for laptop GPUs at present. These laptops are high-end systems (gaming or mobile workstations) and can run Arch Linux (with KDE) provided you install the NVIDIA proprietary drivers for CUDA support.

Each entry includes key specs and a price estimate (in GBP), along with a store link. *No budget limit was assumed, so very high-end configurations are included.*

**Notes:** The NVIDIA **RTX 4090 Laptop GPU** (Ada Lovelace architecture) provides 16GB GDDR6 VRAM and thousands of CUDA cores, which is ideal for large AI models. The listed **workstation-class** GPU, **NVIDIA RTX 5000 Ada Generation**, is essentially the pro version of the 4090 Laptop GPU (also 16GB VRAM) with additional pro driver support and ECC memory features. Older generation mobile workstation GPUs like the RTX A5000 were similarly capped at 16GB VRAM. *No current UK-available laptop offers more than 16GB VRAM on-board – 24GB+ VRAM is found only in desktop GPUs (or future releases) as of 2025.*

## CUDA & Linux Compatibility

All the GPUs above are **CUDA-compatible** and will work with NVIDIA’s Linux drivers and CUDA toolkit. You’ll need to use NVIDIA’s proprietary driver (e.g. the `nvidia` package on Arch) – the open-source `nouveau` driver will *not* support CUDA or the performance required. In Arch Linux, after installation you should install `nvidia-dkms` (for the kernel module) and `cuda` toolkit, then enable Secure Boot compatibility or disable Secure Boot to load the drivers. Once set up, these GPUs can run AI frameworks and inference workloads with full acceleration (e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow will recognize the GPU).

**Linux on High-end Laptops:** Running Linux (Arch or others) on these high-end laptops is **feasible**, and many users do so, but be prepared for a few tweaks:

* **Hybrid Graphics / MUX:** Most gaming laptops have both an integrated GPU (Intel or AMD iGPU) and the NVIDIA dGPU. For maximum performance (and fewer driver headaches), it’s often recommended to switch to “discrete GPU only” mode in BIOS (if supported) or use a MUX switch to disable hybrid graphics. This avoids issues with NVIDIA Optimus on Linux. If you cannot disable the iGPU, you can still use NVIDIA Prime Render Offload or programs like `optimus-manager` to select the NVIDIA GPU for workloads. (The **Asus ROG** models, for example, include a MUX switch/Advanced Optimus for Windows; under Linux, many users set them to dGPU mode via BIOS for stability.)

* **Driver Support:** NVIDIA’s Linux driver fully supports the RTX 40-series and Ada GPUs (the RTX 4090 and RTX 5000 Ada are supported by current drivers). CUDA will function normally once the driver is installed – these GPUs have the same CUDA capabilities on Linux as on Windows. For instance, the RTX 4090 mobile has 9728 CUDA cores and supports the latest CUDA features. Make sure to use a recent kernel and driver for best results (Arch tends to be up-to-date).

* **Power Management and Dynamic Boost:** Some gaming laptops use NVIDIA Dynamic Boost (shifting power between CPU/GPU). On Windows this is handled by drivers; on Linux, Dynamic Boost may not always work or might be less effective. In practice, this just means the GPU might run at a fixed TGP. If needed, you can manually set power limits using NVIDIA’s command-line tools (`nvidia-smi`) or ensure your laptop’s firmware is updated. Linux power management for CPUs (especially Intel 13th Gen and AMD Ryzen 7000 series) also benefits from using a modern kernel and enabling CPU frequency scaling drivers (`intel_pstate` or `amd_pstate`).

* **Cooling and Fan Control:** High-performance GPUs generate a lot of heat. Fan control on Linux might require third-party tools. Many laptops expose fan controls via ACPI or EC (Embedded Controller). For example, **Asus ROG** laptops are supported by the open-source `asusctl` and `rog-control-center` tools (from the asus-linux project) which allow switching performance profiles and controlling fan curves/RGB. Asus has also improved their ACPI tables in BIOS updates to better support Linux, so updating the BIOS on a new ROG laptop is wise. **Lenovo Legion** laptops generally work well; the Legion’s firmware typically allows Linux to control fans automatically, but community tools like `liquidctl` can help control the optional per-key RGB, etc. **Dell/Alienware** machines usually have good Linux support out of the box (Dell offers Ubuntu on some models), and fans can sometimes be managed via the i8kutils driver or BIOS settings. **Clevo/Sager (OEM for brands like Medion, PCSpecialist)** often have an EC control utility (`ectool` or third-party apps like “Clevo Fan Control”) if needed. In short, for each model there is likely a community of Linux users – it’s worth searching forums or GitHub for your specific model plus “Linux” to find if any tweaks are recommended.

* **Peripheral Compatibility:** Other components (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, webcam, etc.) in these laptops are generally Linux-friendly. Almost all high-end models now use Intel or AMD Wi-Fi 6/6E modules which have Linux drivers in-kernel. For instance, the Intel AX series Wi-Fi in the MSI/Asus is supported (just ensure firmware `linux-firmware` is installed). RGB keyboards and touchpad should work as basic input; special features (per-key lighting, macro keys) may need user-space tools (e.g. OpenRGB or vendor-specific projects).

In summary, **no major blocking issues** prevent these laptops from running Arch Linux with CUDA workloads. The **NVIDIA GPUs provide full CUDA acceleration on Linux**, and any minor hurdles (hybrid graphics, performance tuning, fan control) can be addressed with existing community solutions. Given the user’s expertise (installing Arch with KDE and handling drivers manually), they should be able to get any of the above machines working for AI inference. Just choose the laptop with the desired balance of GPU VRAM (all are 16GB here), CPU power (Intel 24-core vs AMD 16-core – both are high-end), and other features, and be ready to apply a few Linux tweaks for an optimal experience.
